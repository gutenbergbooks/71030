<p class="ph3">IN WHICH I JOIN THE HIGHER-UPS</p>


<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mom</span>:
</p>

<p>You been complaining there ain’t enough news in my letters,
well you sure will get a load of it this trip of the postman.
Your Mame has been cast for little Cinderella in the
big political show and the fairy-coach is waiting at the door.</p>

<p>This is how it come about, the place was busy and every
girl had a customer but Florabelle and me, when a gentleman
comes in, a top-notcher I can see and takes us in with
a glance. He don’t need but one because Florabelle makes
up her complexion in a dark room and ain’t got the sense
to look it over by daylight. So he comes to my table and sits
and says, “Go to it, lady.”</p>

<p>He has got good hands not soft nor flabby like many of
the big fellows, but you can see he ain’t had to skin them
with hard work. I starts to washing them and gets a look
out of the corner of my eye and I see he’s somewhere in
the forties and a bit of grey in his hair. His cuffs is new
and clean and everything quiet and exactly right.</p>

<p>I says, “Fine weather we’re having,” and he makes the
shortest kind of a noise that means yes and I see he’s thinking
about something and would rather not be bothered—but
what did he come into a manicure parlor for? So I
looks sympathetic and says in a spiritual voice, “There’s
sure a lot of troubles in the world ain’t there?”</p>

<p>They always shows their surprise in their fingers. He
says, “How did you find that out?” Says I, “I got my
own but you needn’t worry my business is to listen to the
gentlemen’s.”</p>

<p>“Is that a part of the job?” says he and I tells him it’s the
principal part. “They want to tell their troubles to some
other woman;” and I looks up, and there is wrinkles of fun
in the corner of his eyes.</p>

<p>But they don’t last long he looks serious again and says,
“It may be some other woman could give me a little advice
just now.” I says, “She can if she’s the right woman.”
But still he’s kind of hesitating to take the plunge so I give
him another push. “Is it some mystery of the female soul
you can’t make out?”</p>

<p>“It is just that,” he says; and I asks, “She can’t make
up her mind that she loves you?” He laughs and says,
“No, it ain’t anything like that, you been reading novels. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
am a married man and got three children growing up,” he
says. “Ah, me!” says I. “You should hear some of the
stories about married gentlemen!”</p>

<p>I looks at him again and see he’s what they call a go-getter.
First I think maybe he’s the secretary of the Hardware
Dealers’ Association that’s in town but then I guess
he’s a lawyer come to lobby here in our national capital. So
I rubs away at his nails and says, “Is it the wife?” He
thinks for a minute and then all of a sudden it busts out,
“My God!” And then he waits again and says kind of
solemn-like, “Tell me this do all women have to go crazy?”</p>

<p>I make a guess at his age and I says, “How old is your
wife—if you know?” “She’s forty-two,” says he. “Oh,
yes,” says I; and then, “She can’t make up her mind what
she wants, and she can’t sit still in one room—”</p>

<p>“Good God,” says he, “it is worse than that, she is got
the angina pectoris.”</p>

<p>“Oh, poor soul!” I says. I hadn’t never heard of it but
it sounded serious.</p>

<p>“But it’s different from any sort of angina pectoris you
ever heard of,” he goes on. “It’s a travelling angina pectoris.
One week it’s in the shoulders and the next week it’s gone
to the stomach and the week after that it’s in the knee.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ve took her to the doctors?” says I.</p>

<p>“Doctors?” says he. “I’ve worn out four sets of tires taking
her to doctors. The ordinary doctors won’t do at all
it has got to be a specialist of the knee, or the stomach or
what you will. And he tells her there ain’t anything there
but then she thinks maybe he didn’t look careful enough
or maybe I called him on the phone and told him to spare her
nervous system so she has to go to another one without telling
me—but he always tells me with a bill!”</p>

<p>He says it without any smile and he sits there in the bottomest
pit of the dumps so I says, “I suppose you know
what is the matter with the poor soul at her time.” “They
tell me it’s the change of life,” he says; and I says; “Some
ladies in my profession have got a different name they call
it the change of wife.”</p>

<p>Then again I feels the start in his fingers and I know
he’s looking at my head bowed over his nails. “Is that an
old gag,” says he, “or do you make them?”</p>

<p>“You just seen it come out of the mint?” says I.</p>

<p>“Well,” says he, “I’m sorry I don’t own a gold-mine.”</p>

<p>Says I, “There is a plenty of gold-diggers in the manicure
profession, and you might of had some of them trimming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
your cuticle right now if you had of went to some other
table. But I am one that makes it plain to a customer that
he is the butter.”</p>

<p>“Butter?” says he, and I give him a flash out of the corner
of my eye. “Nine hours every day I earns my daily bread
in the Elite Beauty Parlors; and then if in the evening some
gentleman invites me to dinner, he’s the butter.” So then
I seen that we was friends, and I knew I would like that
dairy.</p>

<p>But still he was kind of shy and it wasn’t till I was done
that he come right down to it, he was lonesome and would
like to have me go to dinner with him the next evening but
the trouble was he couldn’t afford to go to no swell place on
account of having so many people in this town that knew
him. But I tells him that two is a company for me and
we’ll go to any quiet place that he likes. “You got to be
extra careful,” I says, “because Washington is an awful
place for gossip.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says he, “and the truth is I hold an especially
prominent position. And so—you see—”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see perfectly,” I says, “I know a gentleman when
I meet one and I hope I know how to be a lady. You may
count on me to play the game square.”</p>

<p>But even that don’t satisfy him he kind of hems around
and he says, “You must understand, I am in a position
where you will be sure to find out who I am right away.”</p>

<p>“I see,” says I, “and so you’ll have to give me your real
name? You may trust me, Mr.—er—”</p>

<p>“Er-Edgerton,” says he, not more than one-third sure that
he wants to.</p>

<p>“Mr. Edgerton,” says I and he see’s I’m thinking it over.
“No,” he says, “you never heard it before, it ain’t a name
that is advertised on toilet soap, nor on the silver screen. In
fact I think just now it’s the least advertised name in the
whole U. S. A.”</p>

<p>“In the secret service?” says I for I admit I was intreeged
though I ain’t sure how to spell it. “The most
secret of all services,” says he. “I’m the Secretary to the
Spokesman.”</p>

<p>And there is where your Mame proved herself the prize
dumbbell. “The Spokesman?” says I. “Who is he?”</p>

<p>He laughs as if I had said something specially funny.
“What do you read in the newspapers?”</p>

<p>“Well,” says I, “I read the divorce news of course because
that is what the customers want to talk about. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
I read the murders because I like them. And I read Mme.
Prinker’s beauty hints, and how to grow lean by rolling.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t read what the Spokesman has to say?”</p>

<p>“No,” says I. “What paper does he write for?”</p>

<p>He laughs again, like that was an awful boner. “It’s
on the front page of all the papers,” he says. “But you
haven’t missed much. The Spokesman is a Man who lives
in a great white house and He is a Strong Silent Man and
it appears that all Strong Silent Men have to talk a great
deal and this One has got no idea what to say. So I am
the man who tells Him what to say. And twice every
week the reporters for all the newspapers of the whole
world gather in a room and listen to Him say what I have
told Him to say and a couple of thousand newspapers all
over the world pay a couple of hundred thousand dollars
to have it telegraphed to them and they print it and I
don’t know how many hundreds of millions of people read
it and they all have to think that it is the Spokesman who
spoke it, so you see how important it is that I should keep
hid.”</p>

<p>Well, Mom, by that time I seen what had come to me,
and I sat hardly able to lift my eyelids, to say nothing of my
tongue.</p>

<p>“I have got to have a session the day after tomorrow,”
the gentleman goes on, “and I have no idea what I am going
to say. How can I pay any compliments to American institutions
that I haven’t paid them twenty times before? So
I’ll give you an address of a little Greek restaurant that I
know and if you’ll meet me there at seven-thirty tomorrow
evening you may be able to give me a few ideas of what the
whole world would like to have said to it the next morning.”</p>

<p>And so then he went out, Mom; and here is your baby
Mame sitting in her six by eight bedroom with the smoke
of her pork-chop still in the air writing to ask you if you
have any ideas of what to tell the world for God’s sake
send them quick for I have got my foot on the ladder and
it’s the high altitudes for me. And Mom you dunno how
grateful I am to you for the wise training you give me, I
felt his eyes running over me but I never trembled for I
had remembered what you taught me, always to keep my
dressing table by the window and put it on by daylight and
never to use no peroxide at all unless I was going to use
it every night.</p>

<p class="ph3">IN WHICH I GO BEHIND THE SCENES</p>


<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mom</span>:<br>
</p>

<p>The first thing I got to explain is that I have changed my
name again. The fashions in names changes very fast and
you think you have got a good one but you find it is a flop.
But I never was altogether pleased with Ysabel and have decided
to make it Rosabelle. I think it is much prettier because
when you say Rosabelle Riggs both the words begins
with the same letter and a gentleman told me that is called
illiteration and a name is much sweller when it is illiterate;
all the movie stars are doing it they say you can’t get into
the movies at all unless you have got an illiterate name.
The new girl at our place is named Mary May Marie, and
that is nice too only you have to say the last name French
fashion, “if you don’t,” I says to her, “it sounds like a
hint to the gentlemen.” It is getting to be swell to have
French names. Ada Huggins has changed hers to Adaire
and then Hattie Schoenstein she says, “What shall I make
mine?” and I says, “Why not try Hotaire?” and that is
how I get into trouble being too bright altogether.</p>

<p>I want you to please explain to Pop, so that he will not
have his feelings hurt that I do not like the good old-fashioned
honest label of Mame that he gave me. This is
not an old-fashioned beauty parlor that I work in and you
can’t expect to know what is considered shiek if you spend
your whole life in the gas-house district of Camden New
Jersey. And I know Mom how you gave up a glorious
stage career for your little ones, and this little one is much
obliged but I got my own career to make now and I sure
don’t want no enemy to paste the label of Mame onto me.
But of course I’m always the same to the home folks
your affectionately.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>P. S. Well, I have just got back from dinner with my
new gentleman friend. I will not say much for a Greek
restaurant. It seems that the way you tell Greek cooking
is that everything is swimming in the juices of baby lamb
only when it gets a little cold it seems like what we at home
used to call mutton suet. Mr. Edgerton explains that the
Greeks is a pastoral people they have only sheeps and goats.
But I would of thought they would of learned the uses of
beefsteak when they come to the good old U. S. A. But I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
suppose they have got to be different as that is called “local
color” when you go out slumming or dining with a gentleman
friend.</p>

<p>But oh Mom the conversation was the most intellectual
that I ever listened to and I am so excited I can hardly make
my letters good. It was just like going to Hollywood and
being took in behind the scenes where you could watch
Mary Pickford putting on her make-up. You that has been
a stage queen can understand how it is everything is so
different behind the scenes you would hardly know that it
is the same show at all. I always thought I was the little
wise girl and nobody could put nothing over on me but now
I am behind the scenes of the political show and oh my
God to think that I was ever one of the boobs that sat out in
front of the curtain and laughed and cried over them old
old gags!</p>

<p>First Mr. Edgerton put me wise to the leading gentleman
that is called the Spokesman. Mr. Edgerton has to spend a
lot of time with Him every day, teaching Him His role,
and he told me all about it, and it was just like I was there
in the great white house where He acts.</p>

<p>It seems that this Spokesman was born and raised in the
State of Florida and that is a very cold state with a great
lot of mountains that is covered with snow most of the
time. It is very rocky ground and hard to raise anything
on and so the people in Florida has got to work hard for a
living all the time and they are very saving and apt to be
stingy for which Mr. Edgerton says you can’t blame them
seeing how nature has been a step-mother to them all. So
this Spokesman’s one idea is to save pennies and when He
was the governor of this State of Florida He used to live
in one hotel room and when the bankers and the big business
men thought that was not dignified enough and He
wanted to show them that He could be as swell as they was
He took two hotel rooms.</p>

<p>The Spokesman is a little Man, kind of stoop-shouldered
and pinched-up like and He is very much worried because
He is not imposing looking like He had ought to be to fit
into that big white house that He has got to act in. Him
and Mr. Edgerton had many consultations about it and Mr.
Edgerton told Him to face it out and make a joke of it and
tell His visitors that He was like a singed cat a lot better
than He looks. At first that hurt His feelings but He must
of thought it over and decided it was His best bet and now
He says it to His visitors. His face is kind of wizened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
and some nasty woman said that He had been weaned on a
pickle but Mr. Edgerton ain’t ever advised Him to say that
to His visitors.</p>

<p>Well now He is the Spokesman and He has got the job
of telling the American people what to do and what to think.
And it seems a queer job for Him Mr. Edgerton says because
if He had His own way He would sit for hours and
never say nothing. He will listen to all Mr. Edgerton says for
Him to say and then bid him good bye and never say if He is
going to say it or not but He aways says it provided it’s two
things—first it must be complimentary to American institutions
and second it must have to do with saving money.</p>

<p>Mr. Edgerton explained to me about what is called the
“policy” of the Spokesman and I don’t see how I could
ever of been happy to be so ignorant as I used to be. I
just never knew nothing Mom I would hear Pop talking
about these things, and it would go right over my head
but now I’m going to learn all about it. It seems that the
way money is wasted is that the government takes it for
taxes and pays it to a lot of office holders that sits with their
feet on the top of their desks. So the Spokesman is going
to stop the taxes and let the rich people keep their money
then He says they will start factories to make things and
there will be plenty of wages for the working people and
everybody will be happy. I never would of thought of it
myself but I seen it right away and how stupid I was when
I felt mean about people that had a lot of money and spent
it on what I thought was foolishness like monkey dinners
and shampain baths and such. I see now that no matter
how foolish it is it all makes work for working people and
so it is all economy like the Spokesman wants it to be.</p>

<p>I asked Mr. Edgerton if that was one of the ideas he had
taught to the Spokesman but he said no he hadn’t needed
to do it because when you are in the business of running for
offices it is a thing you come to understand for yourself no
matter how dumb you may be that you have got to take
care of the rich people because they have got to put up their
money for campaign funds for you so that you can pay
wages for workingmen that makes red fire and sky-rockets
and campaign banners and processions and other things that
educates the voters about not taxing the rich.</p>

<p>And Mr. Edgerton says that the Spokesman went out
and hired the biggest banker in the whole country to help
Him teach the people about this policy of His. And I said
gee how could He of got up nerve to pay such a big man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
what He would of had to pay? But Mr. Edgerton explained
that He didn’t have to pay the big banker nothing extra
because the banker had been paying pretty close to a million
dollars in taxes every year himself and naturally it was
worth something to him to get a chanst to dump a load like
that off of his own shoulders. And that is easy to see too
and I begin to see it wouldn’t be so hard to run a government
as I thought it would be because everybody would be looking
to get something and so they would all be ready to work
for the government cheap. And Mr. Edgerton says that is
just how it goes because a lot of them worked for the government
all through the war for a dollar a year and they
was the most expensive men the government ever had let
inside the ropes. And Mr. Edgerton says that the way I
understand everything shows that I have a natural talent
for political life.</p>

<p>He told me the name of this big banker that has been
hired to take the taxes off of himself. I remember it was
Lemon or Melon or something else to eat. Mr. Edgerton
said I could remember it easy by the fact that they cut him
every day in Wall Street and I said “I don’t see why they
should cut him when he is doing their work for them as well
as for himself.” And Mr. Edgerton thought that was very
funny so I see there was some catch in it so I talked about
something else as quick as I could.</p>

<p>But Mr. Edgerton says I can be very useful to him if I
will and he showed me how. He says that he has been to
college and has read a lot of high-brow things and that has
spoiled him some for the job he has to do. He says he
wants to keep close to the heart of the plain people to
know how they feel and think and I can tell him. I had
a wonderful spiel fixed up, about how I was the daughter
of an old Virginia family that had been ruined in the civil
war; but when I heard what he said I decided I had better
forget my spiel so I confessed that my Pop was a gas-house
worker in Camden New Jersey and he said that was fine
that was exactly what he wanted. And so I told him the
real truth about my name being Mame and so you can forget
what I wrote you in the beginning of this letter which
was wrote yesterday but I will send it to you all the same
because it is wrote and you can see how I have growed under
the influence of Mr. Edgerton.</p>

<p>And he says to me, “What do you think about the international
situation?” And gee I was scared out of my wits I
wanted to say, “Ask me something easy!” But I am going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
to learn to play my part among these higher-ups and so I
says, “I haven’t thought so much about it of late.” And he
says, “It is changing so fast, you have got to think all of the
time.”</p>

<p>And there I sat racking my wooden brains to think of
anything I had ever heard Pop say. And at last I thought
of something and so I looked real wise and I says, “It seems
to me the American people has got so used to having a good
time they take it for granted. So the use of the international
situation is to show them what real troubles is and
make them grateful for their favors.” And Mr. Edgerton
looks at me and his eyes lights up and he says. “That’s it
exactly! That’s the text for my tomorrow morning’s interview!”</p>

<p>And then of course I was very much excited and I says,
“You mean the Spokesman ain’t never said that before?”
And he says, “Well, if He has, it’s been so long ago that
He’s forgot it. But that sentiment is right out of the heart
of the plain people it has the true salt of homeliness that
I’m looking for and torture my poor head trying to invent.”</p>

<p>And so now, Mom, you can imagine how excited I am.
The Spokesman is to give that interview tomorrow morning
at ten o’clock to all the reporters of all the newspapers in the
whole world and it will be in the second edition of the afternoon
papers that gets out all over the whole world just a
little before noon and make believe I won’t pounce on a
newsboy when I go out to get my glass of malted milk at
the corner drug-store! Oh Mom you can’t imagine the
thrills of being a really influential person like</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LETTER_III">LETTER III</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">IN WHICH I RING THE BELL</p>


<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mom</span>:<br>
</p>

<p>Well, I suppose you seen my ideas in the papers. I have
never had anything so wonderful happen to me in my whole
life. There it was every bit of it and all fixed up in such
fine language as I could never of thought of and sounding so
very very wise. And to think that this greatest Man in
the whole world has said it, and every newspaper in the
whole world almost has published it on the front page.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
Why Mom He didn’t say hardly anything else at all. He
made his whole interview out of that idea I have give to His
secretary. Me poor little Mamie Riggs, manicurist in the
Elite Beauty Parlors with just one copper cent in her
pocket this night!</p>

<p>That is a fact! I spent three cents for that afternoon
paper so I didn’t have the price of my usual malted milk for
lunch and had to take a glass of plain milk and a doughnut.
But I didn’t mind that, I went back to the shop feeling so
smart the girls all seen there was something and they wanted
to know, “What is it, Mame, you got a new beau?” That’s
all they ever think about of course.</p>

<p>I says, “No it ain’t that it’s something more great.” But
I didn’t dare give them no hint because it’s what Mr. Edgerton
calls a state secret. So Ada Higgins she wants you to
call her Adaire now and did you ever hear of anything so
silly, being ashamed of her origin and trying to put on side
she says, “I know, it’s that swell gent that was here a few
days ago. What’s his line Mame?”</p>

<p>And just then the phone rung and it was Mr. Edgerton
calling and he wants me to have dinner with him again and
of course then all the girls is buzzing like a lot of bees they
never heard of such a thing as my not telling they always
tell about their affairs because after all what have they got to
talk about between customers with the pitiful narrow lives
they live and no great ideas about world events and no way
of getting behind the scenes of the political show and seeing
how the actors is made up.</p>

<p>Well he says for me to meet him at a Chinese restaurant
this time. It is over in Z street and a long ways and gee
it is drizzling and I shall have wet feet when I get there.
But I dassn’t try to borrow a nickle from my landlady because
my rent was due four days ago and I am side-stepping
because I just had to get a new scarf to hide my old dress.
It is all very well for Mr. Edgerton to talk about wanting
to keep close to the plain people, and the rough honesty of
them and all that, but no man wants to go out to dinner
with a slouch you know that Mom and it ain’t going to
happen while I’m the lady. So now I’m off and tell Pop
to send me some of his ideas about politics as quick as a
postage stamp will bring them.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>P. S. Well it was my first dinner a la Chink and we
had chop suey and it is made out of chicken and something
else that should be called guey instead of suey. But it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
hot and very filling and that is the principal thing when you
are trying to pull through and go straight on eighteen-fifty
per and rents what they is in the city of Washington, D. C.
Mr. Edgerton brought me home in a taxi and now I have
got my feet in bed and I couldn’t go to sleep anyhow till
they get warm, so I will tell you what happened.</p>

<p>Well of course we talked international affairs since that
is the most interesting thing in the world, and what everybody
talks here in high society. Mr. Edgerton says that
when he told the Spokesman the great idea that I had give to
him, He grunted, and that is eloquence from Him. And He
told Mr. Edgerton to have it wrote out for Him and He even
added a couple of sentences of His own because some of it
was so important that He wanted to say it twiced.</p>

<p>And of course I had to be modest so I says, “I really
didn’t think it was so remarkable as that, it is what anyone
would say.”</p>

<p>And Mr. Edgerton says, “That’s it exactly. What I have
to do is to find out what anyone would say and say it for
them.”</p>

<p>“But why,” I says—“when they can just as good say it
for themselves?” So he explained that people likes to have
things said for them it is less trouble and it pleases them to
hear their own ideas, “it is like looking at themselves in a
mirror, if you understand what I mean,” says he and I says
that most any woman would understand that.</p>

<p>And Mr. Edgerton says that the Spokesman likes to say
things like the sort that I say, because it saves Him having
to talk about other things that ain’t so easy for Him to think
about. The reporters asks Him questions and He don’t know
what to answer and then there is always people trying to get
Him to do this and that and to say yes or no and He don’t
like to say either nor to do neither. The Spokesman’s other
name is Cautious, and He never does nothing He don’t have
to and He seldom does. He says that most problems solve
themselves if you let them alone.</p>

<p>Says I, “What that generally means is that somebody else
solves them.” And Mr. Edgerton laughs and says, “Well,
yes, but then if they solve them wrong it ain’t your funeral.”</p>

<p>And he showed me how it goes. There will be two big
fellows fighting over some juicy bit of graft and they come
to Washington and pull all the strings they know of each of
them trying to get the Spokesman to give it to his gang. And
the Spokesman listens polite to both of them and tells both of
them He’ll do the best he can and then He don’t do nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
and both of them hates Him like poison and calls Him all
the names they can think of. But bye and bye they get tired
of quarreling and patch up some sort of agreement to divide
the graft and then they go off and think it over and say
to themselves by golly that Guy is a slick one, He knows
how to take care of Himself and that’s the Sort we need
to run the country.</p>

<p>Well just about that time a couple comes into the Chink
restaurant a pair of swell lookers and I see they knows Mr.
Edgerton. The gentleman gives him a bow and the lady too
but then she gets a glimpse of me and she freezes up like
she was hit by an artic cyclone and she goes by with her
nose high up like an aeroplane. And I see that Mr. Edgerton
is a bit flustered and don’t know what to talk about next
and I says, “It seems your lady friend don’t like the way I
look perhaps she thinks my hair is too decorative or some
thing.” And he smiles, kind of sickish like and I says, “Let
me tell you how it is if you want to have anything pretty in
the gas-house district of Camden New Jersey, you have got
to carry it along with you.” And he says, “Yes, I suppose
so.”</p>

<p>I see he is badly rattled so I says, “I want you to know
that I know exactly how it is and you don’t have to try to
fool me or yourself. Everything is pure and sweet between
us like we was the two babes in the woods but I know too
you ain’t going to get Washington smart society to believe it.
And I can guess how it’ll be if anybody tips off Mrs. Edgerton
to the fact that her husband is doing research work
among the plain people. By the way how’s the poor soul getting
along?”</p>

<p>“Well,” he says, “just now the angina pectoris has moved
on to one of her toes.”</p>

<p>“Well,” says I, “at least it’s getting as far away from
her mind as it can and maybe it’ll move out altogether. But
what I started to say is this if you think you better not see
me any more—”</p>

<p>“No, no!” he says real anxious. “No, Miss Riggs, please
don’t desert me in this crisis.”</p>

<p>“Crisis?” I says.</p>

<p>“Yes,” says he. “You see, the Elks’ convention is coming
to our national capital next week and the Spokesman has
got to deliver a full hour’s speech to them and you just can’t
imagine how I shall be put to it to invent something different
to say. Only think of it I’ve got to work up some new compliment
to pay to the Constitution! And every Fourth of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
July for a hundred and fifty years some twenty thousand
orators have been warming up this old soup and putting in
new flavors. Miss Riggs the great heart of the plain people
has got to save me! You must tell me what to say—you
and none other!”</p>

<p>So there I am up against it again and I wishing I could
get home so as to see if a letter has come from Pop.
“America,” I says, “is a great country.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” he says, “but why? And how? What
makes it that way? What—”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” I says, “one question at a time. It is very
simple you get yourself mixed up by thinking too hard.
Anybody can see that what makes America a great country
is because there is so much of it. Ain’t that so?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he says but kind of doubtful.</p>

<p>“And because there is so many people in it. Ain’t that
so?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” he says but still like he didn’t.</p>

<p>“You take these here Elks that is coming to Washington,”
I says. “Everybody knows the Elks is a great order
and why? Because there is so many of them and they’ve got
a pile of money and they come here and spend it and raise
a hurrah and they own the town. Ain’t that so?”</p>

<p>Yes of course he can’t deny that is so. But still there is
something eating him. “Surely Miss Riggs there must be
something else—some ideas—”</p>

<p>“Ideas?” I says. “Don’t you worry about ideas the
people will tend to that, there is enough of them. If there is
one person and he has got an idea,” I says, “that is something
but when there is a hundred million has got it, that’s a
hundred million times as much and if you don’t think that’s
so you just go and ask Kayser Bill,” I says.</p>

<p>And say, Mom, it was like a light begun to shine in his
eyes. “Miss Riggs,” he says, “do the people really believe
that?”</p>

<p>“Of course they believe it,” I says. “Who’s going to
stop them?”</p>

<p>And Mom, I thought he was going to reach across the
table and grab my hand in spite of his lady friend across the
way shooting eye-daggers at him. “Miss Riggs,” he says,
“you have saved me! You have restored my faith in the
sublime principles of democracy! You have given me the
theme of an immortal address a real piece of Elkoquence if
you will pardon the pun. Upon these wings the Spokesman
will soar to heights never before attained even by Him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>And Mom, he is so pleased, he invites me to go home in a
taxi; and how can I tell him that my feet is wet and froze,
and I would of rather of walked?</p>

<p class="ph3">IN WHICH I GUESS A RIDDLE</p>


<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mom</span>:<br>
</p>

<p>Well the Elks is come to town and they own it just like
I said they would. My it is wonderful to see so many fine
redblooded gentlemen on the streets all looking like their
pockets couldn’t hold their money. For the manicure business
it is heaven there just ain’t enough lady operators to go
round a couple of gents is waiting their turn at each chair
and a girl can have all the dinners and other dates she can
take care of. But I have turned them all down their compliments
don’t go with me at all because of this work that I
have got to do with Mr. Edgerton that is so very important
as you will understand. It seems hard to believe that such
a chanced could happen to a girl out of the gas-house district
of Camden New Jersey but it really is true, and Mr.
Edgerton says I can do just as much guiding the destinies of
the American people as I want to.</p>

<p>I suppose you read the great address which the Spokesman
delivered to the Elks’ convention and you seen every
word I had said to Mr. Edgerton for the Spokesman to say.
Of course Mr. Edgerton fixed it up again so that it sounded
fine and Elkoquent—he keeps calling it that, it is a sort of
joke on account of having been said to the Elks. It sure
did thrill me to read it and I was more prouder than ever
to live in such a rich country with so much wonderful
prosperity all around me.</p>

<p>I must say there is times when I wish I could have
just a little more of it for myself. It is kind of hard on a
girl that has been brought up right and is trying to earn
everything not just her clothes. Right now I have got to
put another darn in my best pair of skin-colored stockings
and it will be very disfiguring right where the gentlemen
look at them most. But I could not keep my landlady waiting
no longer, and I have cut down on my meals all I dare
I can’t afford to be too starved when I go out with Mr.
Edgerton because it ain’t refined to hog your dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>Well Mom this noon going out for my lunch I run into
what I think is his wife—anyhow I hope it is because I
would be sorry to think there was a third lady in this case.
She was in a car with him, one of these kind that is called
coops like glass show cases rolling round on big rubber
tires. They had just drawed up by the curb and she was
getting out.</p>

<p>I have told him that I will play the game so of course I
didn’t give no sign that I had ever saw him before. But I
got a good look at her and she is sure something elegant you
can bet there ain’t any holes in her silk stockings nor in the
squirrel-skin coat that she had on. She is a large soft lady
and they went into an office building so I guess he was taking
her to another of them fancy-priced specialists to see if they
can find that angina pectoris. I went off thinking what
would of happened to me if I would of took the notion that
I had the angina pectoris. Would all them specialists be
hunting it or would I just come home and get Pop to show
me the trap-door where you crawl into the gas-tank? But
I realize that I can’t have everything in this world—I can’t
have electric coops and squirrel-skin coats and at the same
time know the great heart of the plain people and be able to
teach the Spokesman how to talk to them.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>P. S. Well I had another call from Mr. Edgerton and
we went out to dinner again and it is his wife like I guessed
and he says the corn specialists says it is not angina pectoris
of the toe, but only her tight slippers. And he started to
apologize because he didn’t speak to me but I told him to
quit his kidding and let us talk about international affairs.
So we went to another restaurant it was a cheap hash-house
this time where you get a coarse dinner for sixty cents and
Mr. Edgerton apologized for it but it was the only kind of
a place where he would be sure not to meet no friends.
We had a little booth where we could sit and talk and Mr.
Edgerton tipped the waiter some and we sat there a couple
of hours and he brought us some coffee a couple of times
and something else that was supposed to be coffee because it
was in coffee-cups but seeing ain’t always believing.</p>

<p>Well the international situation is like this just now. All
them Dago nations over in Europe wanted a lot of money
from us so they could buy the guns and things while they
was canning Kayser Bill. They come over here and borrowed
billions and billions of dollars and now of course
the Kayser is chopping firewood in Holland and we got the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
job of collecting the money and we don’t know how to start.
They are an unprincipled lot these fellers in Europe says Mr.
Edgerton.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” I says. “I read all about them. The
papers call them Bolshivikis.”</p>

<p>“No,” says Mr. Edgerton, “I don’t mean that crowd they
are revolutionists and they say they won’t pay. What I mean
are the French and Eyetalians and Poles and all them—they
say they’re willing to pay of course but then they
don’t.”</p>

<p>“But then,” says I, “what is the difference whether you
say you will or say you won’t if you don’t?”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s a lot of difference,” he explains. “If you say
you will then you’re recognized.”</p>

<p>“What difference does that make?” I says.</p>

<p>“If you are recognized,” says he, “then you can borrow
as much more as you want.”</p>

<p>“My God,” I says, “I wished somebody would recognize
me!” And then I felt kind of mean, for fear he’d think I
meant about him not recognizing me on the street!</p>

<p>He goes on to tell me that the Spokesman is worried all
the time about these debts He lies awake at night and thinks
about them it’s the only question He can’t seem to leave
alone to settle itself. The reason for that is because He was
born and raised in that cold and rocky state—by the way I
made a mistake because I said the name of that state was
Florida but I was a dumb-bell because Florida is another
place. I know now because today there was a feller come in
to try to sell us some lots there it seems there is a boom and
he had some extra-fine land-front lots that could be had
this week only; he explained that they are called land-front
lots because they are in the bay but they front on the land
and they will be on the land when the bottom of the bay has
been moved underneath them.</p>

<p>But the Spokesman was raised in a state that is rocky and
cold, I have forget it again but I think maybe it is North
Carolina because it is far up North. And you see the
worst a man can do in that state is not to pay his debts
and collecting debts is the one thing that the Spokesman can
be sure of knowing how, He has done it all His life. But
He never had so big a debt to collect in his home state in fact
Mr. Edgerton says there has never been such a big debt in
the world. He says that the Statesman has nightmares
about it and imagines that the debt has broke loose and is
rolling down over Him like it was one of them mountains of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
North Carolina. He wakes up all in a sweat and He sends
for Mr. Edgerton in a hurry and insists He has got to know
how He can collect more money than there is in the world.</p>

<p>That sounds like a joke but it’s really so because it is
supposed to be paid in gold and it is twiced as much gold as
there is. Mr. Edgerton says there is a professor in Germany
that is trying to find out how to make more but he has not
got it paying yet and besides they couldn’t get it away
from the professor without another war and that would
mean we would have to lend more money again. But something
has got to be done, else the Spokesman won’t ever be
able to get a good night’s sleep, and it is undermining His
health something fierce.</p>

<p>So you see Mom there was another job loaded onto my
poor shoulders that was never trained to carry such loads.
But I told you I was going to see it through and I sat there
and thought real hard and I says, “Them Dagoes got goods
from us with that money, didn’t they?” And he says they
did, so I says, “Then the way to pay the debts is for them
to send us back some goods, whatever kind they can make
that we need.”</p>

<p>But he says, “No, Miss Riggs that would never do at
all,” he says, “and the reason is that we have got factories
over here to make all the goods for ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Well,” says I, “but we can have twiced as many goods.”</p>

<p>“No,” he says, “our people haven’t got the money to buy
so much, and so it would shut our factories down, and all
our people that works in the factories would starve.”</p>

<p>Well Mom it shows you how dumb and ignorant us poor
working people is. I would never of thought of that would
you? But it is plain as day—why we have even got what
is called tariff laws to tax the things that is brought into the
country so as to keep them Dagoes from dumping their
cheap goods off on us and putting all our working people out
of their jobs.</p>

<p>I seen then why the Spokesman was so unhappy because
if we couldn’t take money and we couldn’t take goods what
could we do about the debts? If they wasn’t paid at all you
can see what a bad example it would be for nobody would
want to play the business game at all if they would never get
paid their money if they made too much.</p>

<p>Well I must say I was scared because if all these greatest
minds in the world hadn’t been able to guess the answer
what chanced was there for poor little Mamie Riggs of the
Elite Beauty Parlors? But I thought and thought and Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
Edgerton set and watched me with an anxious look knowing
how much there was at stake. And at last—will you believe
it Mom?—I got it! Yes I did and all the world is going
to know it in a day or two. That is, of course they aint going
to know that I got it but they will be told the answer by
the Spokesman in the big white house where He lives and
tells them answers.</p>

<p>Says I, “Mr. Edgerton, them Dagoes has got a lot of pictures
and cathedrals and things over there ain’t they?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he says, “they have that.”</p>

<p>“And people travel over there to see them all the time
dont they?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes.”</p>

<p>“And it’s what they call culture?”</p>

<p>“Yes of course the very fanciest there is.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I says, “there’s nothing in the world too good for
us so let’s us go over there and get their culture in exchange
for the debts. We can build a lot of fine steamships, and
send a million or two of our people over, and the Dagoes can
put them up at good hotels and feed them and wait on them
and show them round and explain things to them. And for
them that don’t care for art and high-brow things, there’ll be
girl-shows and stuff that will surely be better than paying
bootleggers for what they give us in these here coffee-cups.”</p>

<p>Well Mom that broke up our party. Mr. Edgerton was
so excited that he got up and rushed right off to tell the
Spokesman. He left me to walk home alone in the cold and
it was only then that I begun to think about one thing I had
forgot and that is who is to get the chanced to collect them
debts in Europe? I would sure like a trip to Paris myself
and I know my folks could stand a lot more culture than
they’ll ever pick up in the gas-house district of Camden New
Jersey. But I guess Mom we had better not be greedy I’ve
a notion it will be with the trips to Europe like it is with the
electric coops and the squirrel-skin coats—the people that
gets them will be them that has already got more than they
can use.</p>

<p class="ph3">IN WHICH I LISTEN TO GOSSIP</p>


<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mom</span>:<br>
</p>

<p>Well, I have had my first failure in my new job of telling
the Spokesman what to say to the American people. I went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
out to-day and bought the afternoon paper and He hadn’t
said a word of what I had told Mr. Edgerton to tell Him to
say. He had talked about the money them Dago nations
owes us but all He said was that the debts was a sacred obligation
and the American people would exact a settlement.
But Mom you can see that aint saying nothing when there
aint enough money in the whole world to pay them and we
couldn’t let them send us goods without ruining all our industries.
How can they pay except like I said by our sending
over tourists for them to feed? I am greatly disappointed
in the Spokesman.</p>

<p>Tell Pop I got his letter and I thank him for all the ideas
on politics he has sent. Some of them seems to me very
good and I shall be pleased to make use of them. Mr. Edgerton
says it is the opinions of the plain people that he
wants, and I am sure Pop is plain enough to suit anybody.
Tell him that I don’t wonder he can’t hardly believe this
good fortune that is come to me. But it is God’s truth just
as I have wrote it.</p>

<p>And you can tell Pop he dont need to worry about his
baby girl, because I am taking the best of care of myself.
Mr. Edgerton aint tried to get fresh and I dont think he is
that sort at all. He never says nothing about how I have
such nice long brown lashes over my china-blue eyes. I
dont think he even saw that darn I had put in my stocking
though I forgot and put my foot up on a chair right
where he could see. The truth is I think he loves his wife:
only he dont know quite what to make of her just now and
he’s lonesome for a little female cheerfulness. If he buys
me a dinner it aint going to break him and he’s getting his
money’s worth and more being educated about how the
plain people feels about politics and international affairs.
And besides, Mom, dont forget that I have got a feller by
the name of Walter that I am someday going to marry even
if he is only a poor shipping-clerk in Camden and that ought
to be enough for my Pop to fret over.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>P. S. Well, I have just got home from another dinner
and Mr. Edgerton has told me how I come to lose out with
the Spokesman. He wouldnt have nothing to do with my
ideas for the debt settlement because He says it aint a way
to collect the money but only to spend it and the Spokesman
dont believe in spending no money that you dont have
to. He says most of the plain people dont care nothing
about art and they wouldnt approve of people gadding about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
Europe and as for drinking their wines the Spokesman
jumps a yard any time anybody tries to get him to say anything
about prohibition one way or the other excepting only
that laws is laws and all good Americans should obey them.</p>

<p>Mr. Edgerton says that if I am going to be useful to him
I have got to learn the rules of this game and one of
them is that the Spokesman will never take sides in no dispute.
It is His business to be popular and you can never
get Him to say nothing that is going to get a lot of people
down on Him. Ever since He has been in politics which is
since he was a boy He has spent all his time dodging the
tricks of people that was trying to get Him to put His
foot into something and He has got to be the most cautious
Side-stepper they have ever had in the game.</p>

<p>Well Mom we got to gossiping about how things is there
in the great white house where the Spokesman lives and gee
it is comical it is so much like the Elite Beauty Parlors with
everybody watching everybody else and pulling and hauling
and intreeging against them. The Spokesman you see is
just like a King; and all of the courtiers wants to keep his
favor and if He gives three minutes more of His time to
one of them the other one retires into the corner and has a
fit of the weeps or else he goes off and tries to find something
bad about the first one, that he can have his great
aunt whisper to the Spokesman’s second cousin.</p>

<p>Mr. Edgerton says that this great man got into office by
a fluke because he wasnt never meant to get in but only to
be Vice-Spokesman to keep him on the shelf. The Vice-Spokesman
it seems dont have nothing to say or if he does
nobody listens to him. But now He’s got in, and He’s
brought a little bunch of people along that used to be his
angels back in the State of North Carolina or wherever it
is up in the icy North where he comes from. These are rich
men that used to pay the fare of this Spokesman when he
was a little Feller, and was a sort of Office-boy for them
in politics, to run the state like they wanted it.</p>

<p>But now He is got to be the greatest Man in the whole
world and gee they cant quite bring themselves to believe
it and they dont know quite how to take it. They cant
get used to the idea of taking orders from what used to
be their Office-boy and the Spokesman He cant get used
to giving no orders because of course He always feels respectful
to these gentlemen because they have got so much
money and always have paid His way. And at the same
time they are scared to death for fear He might get the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
big head and take the notion to be the Boss. And each of
them hates all the others like poison because each of them
is trying to shove the others away from the Spokesman’s
elbow.</p>

<p>So that is how it goes, and Mr. Edgerton says I am not
to get discouraged if I dont always have my way about what
the Spokesman says. I can be sure that I will win out in
the end because I represent the plain people and they have
got the votes and everybody knows they are the real boss.
And Mr. Edgerton says that just now what the Spokesman
is worried about is what to do about the Reds that seem to
be making an awful lot of fuss and what would I think he
had ought to tell the world about it?</p>

<p>And gee Mom you can imagine how fine that was because
it was one of the things that Pop has wrote to me about. So
I says, “Them fellers had everyone ought to be sent to
jail.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says Mr. Edgerton, “but the trouble is that dont
seem to work out right because then they have a trial and it
puts their ideas on the front page of the papers instead of
the ideas of the Spokesman. It’s kind of provoking but it
works just the opposite of how it had ought to.”</p>

<p>“Well,” says I, “This much is plain if them fellers dont
like the way this country is run they had ought to get out
of it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says Mr. Edgerton, “I have said that and we sent
a couple of hundred of them off to Roossia a few years ago.
But you see there is an awful lot of them and you’ve no idea
what it costs or how it hurts the Spokesman to have to pay
travelling expenses for a lot of Bolshivikis.”</p>

<p>“Well,” says I, “if I had my way I’d cut their journey
short they should be sent to sea in ships of stone with sails
of lead.”</p>

<p>Mom you must tell Pop not to send me no old ones because
that sounded fine to me but it seems that it is a
wheeze in fact Mr. Edgerton was the man that had wrote it
several years back he explained. “You see,” he said, “before
I come to the Spokesman I was shirt-stuffer for a big
admiral and that was the sentence that made his reputation.”</p>

<p>“A shirt-stuffer?” says I.</p>

<p>Says he, “That is what we call ourselves us fellows that
make the big stuffed shirts that the public admires.” It
didnt seem to me that was a very respectful way to talk
about an admiral but I didnt say nothing because I was
trying to remember the rest of what Pop had wrote.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Edgerton,” I says, “I wish you would tell me how
anybody that has got sense enough to make a speech can be
such a fool as to believe in dividing up because can’t
they see that if you was to do it it wouldnt be a week before
the smart ones like you and me would have it all again?”</p>

<p>“Well,” he says, “the fact is that a lot of these Reds dont
want to divide up their idea is just the opposite they want
to concentrate the ownership and have the government run
things.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I says, “and wouldnt that be great?” I says.
“Imagine the Elite Beauty Parlors being run by the government
and all us girls setting with our feet up on the top
of the tables instead of doing our work!”</p>

<p>“Well,” says he, “as a matter of fact wouldnt there be a
lot of customers come in to see that sight?”</p>

<p>But the subject is too serious for kidding so I says, “How
much liberty would us girls have left, if we all had to be
government help? And who would give us our jobs would
we have to go to some politician from North Carolina that
has got the Spokesman’s ear? No, Mr. Edgerton, the prosperity
of this country is based on individual effort and freedom
of everybody to make his own way in the world. Just
compare our wealth with what they have got over in them
bureaucratic and Socialistic lands overseas.”</p>

<p>Mom, that was an awful mouthful, but I had learned it
word for word out of Pop’s letter, I got it off without
a slip and Mr. Edgerton was very much impressed he stopped
joking and sat and thought it over and he says, “Yes, Miss
Riggs, I am inclined to think that is sound doctrine and a
good illustration. I think that will serve admirably for the
talk which the Spokesman is to give to the reporters in the
morning. They have asked Him several embarrassing questions
about the big banker in his cabinet who has been let
off a lot of his income taxes, and these ideas of yours I am
sure He will consider much more suitable for public discussion.
I think I had better run over and see Him at
once and make the suggestion.”</p>

<p>So then we gets up to go and then oh Mom a most dreadful
embarrassing thing happens. Mr. Edgerton goes for to
pay the bill for our dinner and the coffee and the other
things in coffee cups that we has had and he takes out his
leather wallet and finds that the least he has is a hundred
dollar bill. He takes it out and gee it most burns my eyesight
it is more money than I ever seen all at once in my
whole life before—just a little bit more than I earn in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
month only I get it by the week and it has started to go before
it comes. Well the waiter looks at it and says somethink
about not thinking they’d have change for that at the
desk and Mr. Edgerton says to me, “Do you happen to have
a smaller bill with you Miss Riggs?”</p>

<p>And gee there I am knowing that I have got just exactly
seventeen cents in my purse! So I have to think quick and
I says that I dont think I have anything smaller than a ten-spot
myself. And then the boob waiter busts in and says
they wont have no trouble in changing that at the desk!
So then I have to open my purse and play the game of being
very much surprised that I have left my ten-spot at home
and of course I am turned red all the way down into my
blouse because how will Mr. Edgerton have any respect for
my opinions about world finance if he knows that I have to
go round the day before payday with only a few coppers to
buy my lunch with?</p>

<p class="ph3">IN WHICH I PUT ON THE GLAD RAGS</p>


<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mom</span>:<br>
</p>

<p>Well I am glad the family finds my letters interesting
these things is sure different from anything that ever happened
to me before and I guess to any girl from Camden
New Jersey.</p>

<p>Well, I am having a funny time right now in the Elite
Beauty Parlors. The girls is just ate up with curiosity they
know I have got some big fellow on my string somebody
seen me with him somewhere and they cant make out why
I wont tell. They say I’m a boob to think I can hide him
they will sure track him down but I just laugh at them.
There is an extension phone in Madame Lafferty’s private
office and whenever I am asked to the phone she is always
listening in but all she hears is that a gentleman named Mr.
Brown says for me to meet him at the usual place and
that dont tell her much. Sometimes I write these little notes
to you in between customers, and of course that intreegs
the girls a lot too and Ada Huggins—her that has changed
her name to Adaire the silly fool—she says, “What is it
Mame are you writing your mamewars?” That is supposed
to be smart but it aint so very.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>Well just now the phone rung and it was Mr. Edgerton,
and he asked me if I could get off at five this afternoon and
meet him and of course that wasnt easy because it is our
busiest hour but he said it was a very urgent matter so I
said I would try my best to be there. And then I went to
ask the Madame and gee she was sour she says, “What is
this that I am running a beauty parlor or a date ranch?”
You see she pretends the girls aint supposed to meet the
customers outside but gee what a howl there would be if I
was to ask for enough wages to buy my own dinners! And
we all know she goes out herself and meets a gent with a
glass in one eye and his hair plastered over his bald head,
he calls himself Count Skrimsky but I’m telling you he’s no
count in any way you mean it. Well I says she can dock my
pay or I’ll stay two hours of my afternoon off and then she
tries to find out who is the gentleman and I tell her it is
a government matter and I have been forbid to say and
you can imagine how much pleased that makes her!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>P. S. Oh Mom I have just had the most wonderful adventure
that ever happened to a girl. Mr. Edgerton knew
just what he had in mind when he got me to meet him at
five o’clock it was to get to some store before it shut up!
Oh Mom he must of saw that my purse was empty the last
time we went out and he must of got sorry about it. Anyhow
we strolled down the street and there was the Bon Ton
Store with all the lovely things in the windows and he kind
of led me over to look and he says, “They make lots of
pretty things now-a-days dont they.” And I says, “Yes,
they do,” but kind of feeble because I wouldnt have him
think I was thinking I would ever like to own such things.
But he says, “Let’s us go in and have a look at them.”</p>

<p>So we went in and he went to the suit department and
he says to the clerk, “My daughter finds the winters in
Washington more severe than she expected and she wants to
get something nice and warm,” he says, just like that and
gee I nearly faints at the nerve of him. But of course I
have got to go through with it so I says, “Oh, no, Papa, not
now!” but he says, “Yes, right now, I insist.”</p>

<p>So the girl takes one look at him and starts to bringing
out the expensive things and I gasps, “Oh, that will cost too
much!” But he says, “You let me tend to this daughter,”
and so of course all I can do is to stand there. And so he
gets me a tailored suit brown like I had on but oh what a
difference there can be in clothes! It is soft and fuzzy and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
warm like it was an overcoat and yet it is lighter than my
old suit!</p>

<p>And then he says, “We shall have to have a hat and things
to match this suit,” and then I starts to argue that my old
hat will do but he says it wont and before I get through he
takes me round to the shoe department and the glove counter—it
is after the hours and the place is closed and the clerks
is tired and looking cross but he cheers them up with a tip
and so we finish the rounds. And I keep them all on and
when I am going out you would not know it is the same
girl that come in. The clerk wants to know where they
shall send the old things and I don’t dare to give the address
because you see it had ought to be the name of some swell
hotel so I says I am moving and I will send for them; and
of course I will send myself tomorrow.</p>

<p>Well, Mom, I am so rattled I can hardly talk and I says,
“Mr. Edgerton, this aint right I hadnt ought to of let you
do it.” But he says real serious that the ideas I have give
him is worth what he has paid and there wasnt no other
way he could of got them. “But I didnt expect to be paid
for them,” I says and he says, “Well I am paid for them
myself and why should you work for nothing?” he says.
“I have got to keep close to the great heart of the plain
people,” he says, “and to know how they feel and talk and
how else am I to do it? The only thing you got to be
sure is that getting fixed up swell dont spoil you so that
you forget how the plain people feel.”</p>

<p>But I says, “No you dont need to worry about that,” I
says, “because I got my mother and father and my kid
brothers and sisters back in the gas-house district of Camden
New Jersey and how could I forget how they feel?”</p>

<p>“Well then,” says he, “it’s all right and you can go on
telling me and I will tell it to the Spokesman and He will
tell it to the newspaper reporters and they will tell it to the
papers and the papers will tell it to the gas house district
of Camden New Jersey.”</p>

<p>“But,” says I, “What will the missus think about it your
spending so much money on a manicure girl?”</p>

<p>“She aint going to know about it,” he says. “I have paid
cash and I dont suppose you will tell her.”</p>

<p>“Trust me!” I says. “But some of your friends—”</p>

<p>“If my friends was to see me with you now it would be
easier for me to get away with it I could say you was the
daughter of some famous diplomat or of a senator at the
very least.” And of course that made me feel happy and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
just then we come to a movie parlor and he says, “We have
got to learn how to wear our good clothes,” he says, “so let’s
go in and see the latest thing in Hollywood manners.”</p>

<p>So in we go and there is a picture oh Mom the loveliest
story about a poor miners’ daughter in the hills that is kidnapped
by a moonshiner that is an old-fashioned name for a
boot-legger and she is rescued by the handsome young son
of the mine-owner that happens to be visiting the mine and
he comes to love her in the end and they get married in the
loveliest palace all white with sunshine and roses. And
if I had of saw that yesterday I would of said it was
too good to be true but now it all seemed like it was me
and I felt such thrills running over me and I felt so
warm and I whispered to Mr. Edgerton to thank him several
times and I felt just like he really was my father like
he said.</p>

<p>But then I got scared because of course he aint my
father but he’s a man that aint happy with his wife and I am
a girl that is promised to be married some day a long ways
off to a poor but honest shipping-clerk in Camden New Jersey.
And so I have got to keep telling myself that my job
with Mr. Edgerton is to educate him so that he can educate
the Spokesman that is the greatest Man in the whole world
and has the job of educating the greatest people in the
whole world.</p>

<p>But oh Mom it is hard to be a girl and to be young and
to love pretty things and never to be able to have none unless
you go without your lunch every day for a month or
two. I go up to that little box of a room that I live in,
and fry myself a frankfurter or some hamburger on a tiny
oil stove and gee I get sorry for myself and I get sorry for
poor Walter that thinks I am going to marry him some day
and I am of course but oh Mom us plain people do have to
pay a lot for what we learn!</p>

<p>Well we went into a restaurant and as soon as Mr Edgerton
had ordered some dinner I says real determined, “We
have got to get down to business now because I will not feel
happy unless I give you some real good ideas to pay for all
this money you have spent.” So he says that the Spokesman
likes my ideas about the Reds and how to hold them
down, but He thinks that just now it would be better not
to hammer them too hard because this country has got a
lot of machinery and things that it has got to sell and them
Bolshivikis has got a lot of gold and crown jewels that they
want to exchange for ten thousand tractors that is made by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
a friend of the Spokesman that helped him a lot to get
elected.</p>

<p>“Gee,” I says, “I thought them Roossian fellers had got
all them gold and jewels by stealing them!”</p>

<p>And Mr. Edgerton says that is so and perhaps we hadnt
ought to take it but the trouble is if we dont sell the tractors
the tractor factory will have to shut down and that will
leave a lot of good honest American working people to
starve in the middle of the winter. “And so you see,” says
he, “how complicated these here international affairs is.”</p>

<p>And I says, “My God I hardly know how to think my
way around in such a mix-up. That is almost worse than
the problem about getting the debts paid,” I says, “for I
was going to say that to make up with them Bolshivikis
would be like shaking hands with murder.” And Mr. Edgerton
says, “Yes, it was Lord George that said that a few
years ago over in England.” And gee Mom you have sure
got to keep Pop from sending me old ones else I’ll have to
stop using his ideas and think them all up for myself.</p>

<p>Well I done the best I could in a hurry. He said the
Spokesman was very unhappy because of the way the prohibitionists
was fussing because the boot-leggers wasnt
stopped the dries didnt like it because the job of enforcing
the law was left to that banker that is in the cabinet—I never
can remember his name but I keep thinking of Cantelope
though that dont sound right. Well anyhow this Mr. Cantelope
is the biggest manufacturer of whiskey in the country
and the prohibitionists dont seem to think that he is the best
one to catch the bootleggers and I says, “Well, you have
heard the old saying about setting a thief to catch a thief.”
And Mr. Edgerton thought that was clever but he didnt think
it was just the way the Spokesman would want to defend
His friend the great banker in the cabinet.</p>

<p>And so there it was Mom I couldnt think of nothing else
so I have fell down complete and Mr. Edgerton will think
that getting these new clothes has made me stop being able
to feel with the plain people. So please ask Pop to see if
he can think of any reason why a great whisky-maker should
be hired by the government to stop the whisky-business, and
if he can, to write it to me quick. But please dont let him
send nothing that he has read in the papers about it because
Mr. Edgerton is sure to say that is old stuff.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>P. S. Again I been thinking it over and this idea has hit
me that maybe Pop aint really got any ideas at all except<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
what he gets out of the papers and if so I have got to do
this job all alone. I am going to talk it over with the girls in
the beauty parlor because I am sure they dont read nothing
in the papers except the divorces and the crimes and the
beauty hints the same as what I done before I was invited
to help the Spokesman with his speeches.</p>

<p>You should of been in the Elite Beauty Parlors this a. m.
to see what happened when I walked in with my new costume.
I have got to wear it to work you see because I
never know when Mr. Edgerton will give me a ring on the
phone. You would of thought the girls had never seen no
real swell clothes in their lives before they just let out one
yell, and then of course they wanted the whole story when
and where and how and especially how much. And when
I wouldnt tell them I was a cat and Hattie Schoenstein—she
has had a mad on me ever since I told her that the French
way of her name would be Hotaire—well she says, “How
much did you pay the gentleman for that?”</p>

<p>I says, “I paid him some valuable ideas,” and of course
they all thought that was the funniest joke they ever heard
for how could the poor sillies imagine that I was being consulted
about what the greatest Man in the whole world was
to say twiced a week to the newspaper reporters of the
whole world? If I had of told them that they would of
busted with laughing.</p>

<p>But say Mom it is sure wonderful to be dressed right up
to the minute you may say what you please but there aint
any feeling like it. Already today three gentlemen have
asked me will I go out to dinner with them and I have had
to tell them that I have a steady which is the easiest way
of getting out of it as I have to be here whenever Mr. Edgerton
needs me.</p>

<p>Well I have got the afternoon paper, and I see the Spokesman
has not said what I advised Him to say about the Reds.
What He did say was so much wiser I could never of
thought of it myself and it made me have a great reverence
for Him. He says that the Roossians should be allowed to buy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
our tractors because we have got to preserve freedom of
trade because that is the great principle upon which American
prosperity is based. And of course I can see that for if
I had of went into that Bon Ton Store with Mr. Edgerton
and the clerk had of told me that they wouldnt sell me no suit
because maybe they didnt like the looks of me or something
why where would I of been then? And so the Spokesman
said we would not stop the people that come over here
from Roossia to buy things but only them that had come to
teach us ideas that was dangerous.</p>

<p>I will tell you something funny that will show you what
a wonderful thing it is that the Spokesman is doing in educating
all the people in ideas that is safe. I got some of the
girls to talking about international affairs this morning because
you see I want to find out what it is that the plain
people think so that I can tell Mr. Edgerton and he can tell
the Spokesman. I asked them about this business about letting
the Roossians come over here to buy things and they
all got mad and they says no we don’t want none of them
dirty Bolshivikis over here they has went and nationalized
all the women in Roossia and we dont want none of that in
America.</p>

<p>“Then you dont believe in freedom of trade?” I says and
Florabelle McGinnis she flares up, “I believe in every girl
having a right to choose her own feller,” she says, “and if
that aint freedom of trade then what is?”</p>

<p>Well when I come home from lunch I had the paper with
that interview that the Spokesman had give and I hands it
to Florabelle and I says, “See here, the Spokesman has been
talking about what you said.” And so she read it and a little
later I hears her talking with Ada Huggins and she says,
“Well if them Roossians has got the money and its good
money why let them come in I say and buy what they want
because after all freedom of trade is the great principle upon
which American prosperity is based.” Just like that she
said it Mom as if it was her own idea but she had just took
it up because she seen it in the paper the poor silly. But
you can see how very important it is that I should study
these questions and get them right so that I can know what
to tell Mr. Edgerton to tell the Spokesman to tell the Floradumbelles.</p>

<p>Another idea was in that interview and a very important
and wise idea as I can see. The Spokesman says there is
another great principle upon which American prosperity is
based and that is freedom of opinion; everybody has got the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
right to say what they think and so we will have a chance
to find out what ideas is the best. I read that to some of
the girls so as to see what they would say and Hotaire—she
is always looking to say something different from me, so as
to put me into a hole—she says, “Well, if he thinks that, why
is he scared to let them Roossians come in and say their
ideas?”</p>

<p>And did you ever hear anything so silly as that letting
them Bolshivikis come in and shoot off their faces! “Well
but why not?” she says persistent like.</p>

<p>I says, “Why you poor simp dont you know them fellers
brings in a lot of money to try to tear down our government?”</p>

<p>“Well,” she says, “and can they do it?”</p>

<p>And I says, “No of course they cant do it.”</p>

<p>And then says she, “Then why do we have to be so scared
of them?”</p>

<p>“Scared?” I says. “Who’s talking about being scared?”</p>

<p>“Well then,” she keeps on, “why not let them shoot their
faces off?”</p>

<p>“But you simp,” I says, “them fellers would come in
here and buy printing presses and stir up our foreign
labor.”</p>

<p>And she says, “Well if their money is good to buy tractors
why shouldnt it be good to buy presses?”</p>

<p>And so I gets hot under the collar and I says, “You talk
like you was one of them Bolshivikis yourself,” I says, “and
you had ought to be shut up and not allowed to talk no such
rotten ideas.”</p>

<p>“Oh so that’s all you believe in free speech!” she says.</p>

<p>And just then the Madame comes along and she sees we
are having a row and she gives a “Shush!” and looks a few
daggers at us as she goes to welcome a customer. And that
is the way it goes with we girls we are just supposed to sit
here and shine people’s fingers and never open our mouths
at all. We have got no more rights than if we was so many
polishing machines and I tell you Mom I sometimes think
it is more than I can stand. Some day when the Madame
gets off one of her shushes at me I’m going to bust loose
and tell her what I think of her and her ideas that she can
dictate to free Americans the way we talk and the way we
dress and the way we do our hair.</p>

<p>If that ever happens I’m telling you that Lafferty lady
will get the jolt of her sweet life because I have been talking
to the other girls and they all feel like I do and I’ll bet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
if I was to give a little time to it I could get them all to
stand together and win some rights for ourselves. Gee
Mom if I could only get a few dollars ahead some time so
that I could have a little nerve! But it’s the same with
all of we girls our last nickle is gone before the end of the
week. We had ought to have somebody to stake us so that
we could afford to strike and not be starved into giving up!
But of course there aint anybody interested in helping poor
working girls to get their rights.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>P. S. Well I have just come back from having dinner
with Mr. Edgerton. We went to a pretty swell place because
he says I am looking so nice now that no other sort of
place would do for me. And he says I dont never need to
worry about what it costs because my ideas is worth it to
him he has never saw the Spokesman so pleased as with
the ideas I have give to Him lately; he says the Spokesman
almost smiled He was so pleased and once He made a
remark that He didnt have to make and that is something
that does not happen once in a month.</p>

<p>Of course I wanted to know so I says, “What was the
remark?”</p>

<p>And he says, “Why, he says, ‘I went to church yesterday.’”
And Mr. Edgerton of course wanted to be polite so he says,
“Who preached?” And the Spokesman says, “Dr. Wringum.”
And Mr. Edgerton says, “Was it a good sermon?”
And the Spokesman says, “Yes.” And Mr. Edgerton says,
“What did he preach about?” And the Spokesman says,
“Sin.” And Mr. Edgerton says, “What did he say about it?”
And the Spokesman says, “He didnt approve of it.” And
Mr. Edgerton says to me, “That was the end of the conversation.”</p>

<p>Mr. Edgerton laughed like he thought there was something
funny about that but I didnt see nothing funny and
I says, “Well, but that is right ain’t it? You wouldnt of
expected a preacher would of approved of sin?”</p>

<p>And then Mr. Edgerton looks at me like he was studying
my face and he says, “It is wonderful how exactly your
mind is like the Spokesman’s.” And of course that was a
tremendous compliment and I felt all flustered and says,
“Just how is that?” and he says, “You have a serious
mind,” he says. “You have never wasted your time on
foolishness.”</p>

<p>“No,” I says, “that aint quite so but when it comes to
serious things like teaching the whole American people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
about sin,” I says, “nobody would want to make a joke
about that.”</p>

<p>And he says, “There is some evil people that might, but
you wouldn’t, and that is why you understand the mind of
the Spokesman and He almost always likes your ideas when
I tell them to Him.” So Mom you can imagine how near
to Heaven I felt.</p>

<p>Well then we talked about what the Spokesman had said
about freedom of trade and of speech and Mr. Edgerton
says that one of them Bolshiviki fellers has just sent the
Spokesman a telegram saying that since He has come to believe
in free speech wont He please let out some of the fellers
that is in jail for practicing it. So there it is you see
just like I said to Hotaire, how dangerous them fellers is.
I says something that Pop had wrote me, “Liberty dont
mean license.” But Mr. Edgerton says that is an old one
too it seems that all Pop’s ideas is old.</p>

<p>So I says right out of my own ideas I says, “Well I’ll
say this that if a government aint got the right to protect
itself, then what is it for?” And Mr. Edgerton went up into
the air again and he says that is one of the proofs that I
have got a mind just like the Spokesman, I would sure see
that in His answer to the Bolshiviki feller only of course He
wont answer the feller.</p>

<p>Well there we was chatting away as happy as you please
and having such a good dinner too when all of a sudden I
notices there is a feller sitting at the next table all by himself
and he dont seem to have a thing to do but listen to what
we are saying. I gets him out of the corner of my eye and
then I writes a note on the menu and shoves it over to Mr.
Edgerton, “We are being listened to.” So then he begins to
talk about the unusual severe winter we have been having
and by and by he gets a chance to look at the other feller
who is attending to what is in his own plate real hard. And
after that we dont talk no more international affairs.</p>

<p>Well when we get up to go we have hardly got out of the
door before I see the other feller getting up and when we
are walking down the street there he is following us. So
we stop to look in a shop-window and I see him stop too
and I says to Mr. Edgerton, “We are being shadowed. I
must get on a street-car right quick and you get on another
going the other way and we will see what happens.”</p>

<p>So we shook hands and I run and caught a car going my
way home and that is all I know about it for I didnt see
the feller on my car. But oh Mom do you suppose that Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
Edgerton’s wife can of heard how he is taking out a manicurist
to dinner? Or do you suppose it can be some of them
Bolshivikis that is trying to undermine the government by
keeping me from helping the Spokesman keep close to the
great heart of the plain people?</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">IN WHICH I PEEK INTO A PALACE</p>


<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mom</span>:<br>
</p>

<p>If you have got the same habit that I have got of reading
everything in the papers that the Spokesman says you will
of saw how many times He says the things I have said for
Him to say. The last time was that about the government
having the right to protect itself against fellers that
wants to talk about over-throwing it. It come out in the
papers just like I said it to Mr. Edgerton.</p>

<p>Yesterday there wasnt so much news only a story about
how the Spokesman had been delayed for a full minute
after He had got into His automobile by the Spokeslady having
to coax Her dog to get in too. It made a sweet story
for I like to think of Them having a pet that They love.</p>

<p>Today there is another story very interesting. It seems
that the Spokesman has got to have exercise but He is too
busy to go and get it so up there in the great white house
where He stays they have set up an electric camelephant,
that works by machinery and every morning He gets up on
top of it and gives Him a nice ride and shakes Him up and
starts everything inside Him. I think that is a wonderful
idea but I should think it would be rather tiresome riding
on a camelephant and not getting nowhere or any change
of scenery like on a real camelephant. But I suppose the
Spokesman would be too busy to look at the scenery anyhow,
He has got to be thinking all the time about what He
is going to say to the reporters when they come to listen
to Him again.</p>

<p>There was a customer left a magazine in the Elite Beauty
Parlors and in it I see a picture of the Spokesman. Of
course it is not a picture of Him riding the camelephant
but it just shows His face. But I cut it out and took it
home and pasted it on a piece of cardboard and I have set
it up on my bureau so that I can look at Him while I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
thinking up things that I can tell Mr. Edgerton to tell Him
to say to the reporters. I wish that Mr. Edgerton had not
told me one thing about Him that I find myself always
thinking while I look at the picture that He is like a singed
cat because He is better than He looks. Of course I know
there is movie actors that is more sheiks but they have not
got the great ideas of the Spokesman.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>P. S. Well I have went to dinner with Mr. Edgerton again
and it had to be a cheap place because of that scare that
we got from seeing a man that we thought was following
us. Mr. Edgerton says that he does not know any more
about it because the man did not follow him on the street
car. It might be that his wife is having him shadowed because
she is jealous about him giving so much time to trying
to understand the plain people. He says that she is now
certain that a wart which she has got on her shoulder is turning
into angina pectoris and when he tries to persuade her
that it is not so she cries and becomes very excited and says
that he no longer loves her and that she knows he is only
waiting for her to die so that he can run off with some
peroxide blonde. I asks him if that means me and he says
that my guess about it is better than any man’s.</p>

<p>The other thing that it might be he says some of his
enemies might be having him watched so as to get something
on him. I says, “Have you got enemies?” And he
says, “Up there at the great white house I have not got
anything else and neither has anybody else because everyone
is hating everyone else and watching for a chance to lift
his scalp off.”</p>

<p>There is a dozen secretaries up there it seems but Mr.
Edgerton is the special one indeed he is really not a secretary
at all he is just that on the payroll but they dont pay him
very much and the greater part of his pay comes to him on
the side out of funds which is put up by business men
that want to have the say about things. And what Mr. Edgerton
is paid for is to be a kind of guardian to the Spokesman
to tell Him what to say that He wouldn’t know if He
wasnt told. And of course Mr. Edgerton has got the
right to come into the big white house at all hours of the
day or night and it is not many that have got that right
and them that have not got it are intreeging and trying to
pull down they that have.</p>

<p>He said again that it is just like a palace with a king
and his courtiers but as I was never in a palace I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
not tell. And he told me about the people he has to deal
with up there in the big white house and of course I listened
very eager not because I like to gossip but because I have
got to understand about these people if I am going to be
one that has got the job of teaching the Spokesman.</p>

<p>Mr. Edgerton says there is an old gentleman by the name
of Mr. Prows that is a sort of grandaddy to the great Man.
He owns a big department store back in the home town and
it runs itself and all the old gentleman has got to do is to
play around in the big white house and enjoy the thrills of
power. People come to him that wants this and that and he
listens and looks wise and says that he will see what can
be done and he toddles round and ask questions of this and
that and by and by he whispers into the Spokesman’s ear
that the welfare of the party depends upon Pete Whizzle
being made deputy collector of customs at Skunk Center
Montana and if the Spokesman does it then the old gentleman
is proud and happy for a week.</p>

<p>And there is another guy that is a big mill-owner by the
name of Senator Buttles and he has been the Spokesman’s
real boss and now is the political manager and he is supposed
to run the machine and all the other politicians and the
other senators. But he is a flop at the job because you see
he is one of these hard-boiled guys that is used to running
a factory and to say for things to be done just so and if
you dont like it you can get the hell out of here. But the
other senators aint used to the job being done that way
they is mostly old guys of the sporting sort that buy their
bootleg liquor right in the lobby and they dont like the
Spokesman and His blue-nose cheese-paring crowd that He
has brought along from the artic regions and there is war
between them and Mr. Edgerton has to work hard to keep
it from busting into the papers some day.</p>

<p>And Mr. Edgerton says the Spokesman is very worried
about that story about the camelephant. He thinks maybe the
people will think it is not dignified for the greatest Man
in the world to be riding on a camelephant in His pajamas
in His bedroom. And I says, “Well I should of thought
that is just where they would think He should ride,” I says.
“The undignified part would be if He was to ride a camelephant
on the street in His pajamas.” And Mr. Edgerton
says that is quite true and I always think of things in just
the right way and if I am sure that the plain people will see
it that way the Spokesman will be less unhappy.</p>

<p>Mr. Edgerton says there is nothing in the whole world that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
worries the Spokesman so much as being made fun of because
He is very serious about His job and wants people to
be serious about Him. And I says, “Of course He would
have to be,” I says, “for it is no joke to know that a hundred
millions of people is waiting for you to teach them what
to think and a Man that has got to talk to all the reporters
of all the newspapers of the whole world has got a job that
will keep Him looking serious.”</p>

<p>“Well that is just what it does,” says Mr. Edgerton and
he says, “You feel quite sure that it wont hurt Him about
the camelephant?”</p>

<p>I says, “Anybody that laughs about such a thing will be
no good American,” I says. “The plain people like I know
back in the gas-house district of Camden New Jersey,” I
says, “will think that a Man that has to teach them and
govern them and manage their international affairs should be
a sober Man and a moral Man with no time for foolishness,”
I says. “I dont suppose He rides that camelephant for
fun,” I says.</p>

<p>And Mr. Edgerton says, “No it is for His liver.”</p>

<p>And I says, “Exactly He has got to take care of His
liver of course,” I says. “And while He rides He will
have His mind on the government and He will not let Himself
be worried by no laughing jackasses along the roadside.”</p>

<p>Mr. Edgerton says that when the Spokesman saw the
story in print He was fearful peeved and could not talk
about nothing else all day He demanded to know who had
give that camelephant away to the reporters and He told
Mr. Edgerton to go and find out. And Mr. Edgerton
went first to Mr. Grandaddy Prows and the old gentleman
said he was not at liberty to say but in strict confidence he
had an idea that it was Senator Buttles that had give it out.
And then Mr. Edgerton went to Senator Buttles and asked
him who had give it out and Senator Buttles said that he
was not at liberty to say but in strict confidence he had an
idea that it was Mr. Prows that had give it out. And gee
Mom would you think that a palace would be so much like
the Elite Beauty Parlors?</p>

<p>Well Mom I could of listened all day to international affairs
like this but I had got nervous about all this intreeging
and I looks about and there at one of the tables is sitting
the same feller that I seen at the table the other night
trying to listen in on our talk. “Mr. Edgerton,” I says,
“we are being shadowed again.” And after that he was so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
uneasy that his mind was not on what I was saying. And
he says, “When we go out you must let me put you into
a taxi because it will not be so easy for him to follow you
and I will go another way and lose him in the crowd,” he
says.</p>

<p>So he gives me money for the fare and we goes out and
he puts me into a cab and away I go and pretty soon I
look back and there is the lights of another car behind us
and so I watches and that car follows us all the time so I
tell my driver not to take me no farther but to let me out
and I will save most of my fare. And when I get out I see
that the other car stops too and waits to see where I am
going and then it follows slow.</p>

<p>I says to myself, “I will block that little game,” so I slips
into a big hotel right quick. I can do that all right because
I have got on my swell new clothes that Mr. Edgerton give
me so I look like I belonged in one of them places. I goes
into an elevator and slips off at the mezzanine floor and sits
there a while in one of the soft plush seats and a gentleman
comes along and spreads his feathers in front of me—you
know they calls them places “Peacock Alley”—but I
goes on staring straight in front of me and he sees that I
am not his pea-hen and so he goes away. This is not the
man that is following Mr. Edgerton and I you understand
but just some feller that is intreeged by my swell new
clothes.</p>

<p>I dont see any more of the one that was following us so
I go out by another entrance and get home all right. But
gee Mom we are really being spied on and I wonder how
it is they can find us whether they have got the telephone
wires tapped at the Elite Beauty Parlors or whether they
have got one of the girls hired to tip them off to my dates.
You never can tell when you are living in the great world
and have the job of deciding what is to be taught to the
whole American people. Gee Mom it is more thrilling than
any movie that I ever was at!</p>

<p class="ph3">IN WHICH I DON’T GET WET</p>


<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mom</span>:<br>
</p>

<p>Well, I suppose you have saw in the papers how they
are making a lot of fun of the Spokesman because of the
story that He has got a camelephant in His room, so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
He can get His exercise by riding on it every morning in
His pajamas. It is like Mr. Edgerton said He was afraid
it would be they are getting smart about it and not taking
Him respectful like a great Man like Him had ought to
be took.</p>

<p>This a. m. there was a girl in the Elite Beauty Parlors
that had a paper and there was no customers so she was
reading about it and then she begun telling it and they was
all chuckling. It seems this smart aleck in the paper was
saying that this camelephant went about the room with the
Spokesman on the top of it and that it had got unruly and
had bumped Him against the chandelier and the aleck said
the camelephant was built so the electric contact was got
through spurs and that you stopped it by pulling on a pair
of rains and saying, “Ho!” And he said that why He had
got a camelephant not a zebray was because a camelephant
don’t have to be watered more than onced in three weeks
and also because it was the emblem of the dries and so on
a lot of silly stuff that it is a shame to write about a great
Man that has got the hard job of governing and teaching the
whole country.</p>

<p>Well it made me hot to listen to them sillies giggling
there and I says, “That is all a bunch of nonsense,” I says,
“that camelephant does not travel but it stays on one
place and it goes when you press a button and the reason
it is a camelephant not a zebray is got nothing to do with
prohibition,” I says, “but because it is ordered for His liver
and the camelephant is a beast that has got a very bumpy
gate and it shakes you a lot when you ride on him.”</p>

<p>Well and of course that got the lot of them peeved and
Ada Huggins the silly that wants me to call her Adaire
only I won’t fool with such nonsense she says, “What do
you know about it?” And I says, “Never you mind what
I know,” I says, “but I know a lot more than you think
I know.” “Maybe you have been invited up to that big
white house to visit Him,” she says and I says, “Maybe I
have been and maybe I will be I aint telling it to you.”</p>

<p>Well of course that intreegs them a lot, for they have saw
there is something mysterious in my life and they would give
a day’s pay to know but I dont say nothing because it is a
state secret as Mr. Edgerton says and my power to educate
him and the Spokesman would be gone if anybody knowed
that I was doing it he says the newspapers would not respect
the ideas that I give them if it was knowed that they come
from a manicure girl in the Elite Beauty Parlors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>P. S. Well Mom I have saw Mr. Edgerton again and it
is getting to be very exciting because there is sure some
enemy that is shadowing us and trying to find out what we
are doing. Mr. Edgerton says whenever he comes out of
the big white house there is somebody following him but he
managed to shook him off and we had another dinner in
the Greek restaurant where they cook things with mutton
suet and he told me all what is happening. And it seems
that it is very dreadful because the papers all over the
country is laughing about that camelephant and telling all
kinds of silly things like that it makes an awful racket
while it runs or that the Spokesman has got a secretary riding
with him and dictates his male while he goes out for a
camelephant gallop.</p>

<p>Mr. Edgerton says he give positive orders to the reporters
of all the newspapers of the country that nothing more was
to be sent out on that camelephant but it done no good because
the editors was all telegraphing for more and even
cabling from South Africa and China and if the editors
didnt get no more they would make it up anyhow. And the
Spokesman is so worried that He has not been able to
think about governing the country for the past few days
but only scolding about who let the camelephant out of
the stable.</p>

<p>And at last it was found out who done it and it was Mr.
Grandaddy Prows that done it and they had an awful scene
and the old gentleman wept tears and he said that he hadn’t
meant no harm but he only thought that the plain people
would want to know all about the homelife of their great
Man and would like to read about His camelephant just as
they liked to read about the Spokeslady’s pet dog and how
the family automobile had been held up a whole minute
after the Spokesman had got into it while the Spokeslady
was coaxing Her dog to get in.</p>

<p>And the Spokesman said it was not the same at all because
when He was in the automobile with His wife and Her
dog He had something more than His pajamas on, and so
it was proper for the public to think about Him then. He
said that Grandaddy Prows had proved himself without discretion
and that his usefulness to the Spokesman was ended
and the poor old gentleman went off with his heart broken
and now it is announced that him and his wife is starting on
a European tour that he is doing some highly secret diplomatical
errands for the Spokesman.</p>

<p>And of course that is very sad and I am upset too because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
Mr. Edgerton says he cannot get the Spokesman to think
about international affairs at all no more. The reason for
the worry he says is that the Spokesman got into this great
office by accident and He knows that He is wearing shoes
that is many times too big for Him and He is scared to
death that some day the people may get onto the real size
of His feet. And I says, “Oh that explains it then because
I could not see why He was so afraid of being saw in His
pajamas. Because after all I have saw lots of pictures of
screen actors in their pajamas and I have thought they was
lovely. And when you see the pictures of defendants and
corespondents and other people in divorce actions they
do not look so bad at all in pajamas,” I says.</p>

<p>Well the big white house is a mean place to live right now
Mr. Edgerton says with everybody in the dumps or scared
and anybody can get rich quick that can find out a way to
get the American people to talk about any other animal in
the zoo but the camelephant. I says, “Mr. Edgerton, it’s
not that I want money,” I says, “because I am willing to
serve my country for the love of it and I think it had ought
to be possible for the Spokesman to do His great work
without being bothered,” I says, “so let’s you and me figure
out a way to get the people to appreciate and love Him
again.”</p>

<p>So then he looks relieved because he has come to have
great confidence in me because the training I got in the
gas-house district of Camden New Jersey has been better
for this job than what he got when he was in college. So
he says, “All right Miss Riggs let us do it. What do you
suggest?”</p>

<p>And I says, “Any good woman would of been able to of
told you. The Spokesman has got virtues that the plain
people love and what we have got to do is to pick out one
of them and get the people to think about that.”</p>

<p>“Which one do you suggest?”</p>

<p>“You say that His great love is for economy and you
take it from me they may pay a lot of money to boot-leggers
and jazz-bands but deep down in their hearts the American
people aint forgot that the real way to make money is to
save it.”</p>

<p>“Yes I suppose so,” he says but kind of half-hearted.</p>

<p>“Listen to me,” I says. “It is coming on to be springtime
and every man in this country is worried because he
knows he has got to pay a bill for his wife’s new Easter
hat. Now suppose you was to fix it that the Spokeslady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
was not to buy no Easter hat and you give out to all the
newspapers of the world a story that She is making over
Her old hat for this season don’t you know that would
warm the heart of every man in the country?”</p>

<p>Well he thinks it over but then he says, “Miss Riggs what
about all the women that want to have their new hats?”</p>

<p>“Take it from me,” I says, “The woman is fretting because
her husband is spending too much on his new spring
suit so let there be another story that the Spokesman is
getting only a very cheap spring suit say twenty-five dollars.”</p>

<p>“No,” he says, “that would be too cheap they would not
believe that it would sound like a shipping-clerk or something.”</p>

<p>“Well,” says I, “it happens that back in Camden New
Jersey I have got a fyansay that is a shipping-clerk and it
is nothing to be ashamed of,” I says. “But make it thirty-five
or forty-five or fifty-five or sixty-five whatever seems
right—”</p>

<p>“Sixty-five would be about right,” he says. “And come
to think of it Miss Riggs I shouldn’t wonder if you have
saved the day.”</p>

<p>“Let us hope that it is not too late,” I says.</p>

<p>“How do you mean too late?”</p>

<p>“I mean that He has not got His spring suit already and
paid too much for it.”</p>

<p>“But what harm would that do?”</p>

<p>“Well,” I says, “but if it aint a true story it would be
no good.”</p>

<p>“That can be fixed up,” he says. “If the Spokesman has
got a suit that is not economical enough it can be for a
present to His chef up there at the big white house or maybe
for the captain of His yacht,” he says. And then he rushes
away right off because he thinks that if the Spokesman
knows about this He may be able to get some sleep tonight
which is something He needs even worse than exercise for
His liver.</p>

<p>And so then I start out for home and gee Mom it is
awful because it has started to rain. There I am with my
new suit and my new hat and shoes and gloves and I
haven’t got my umbrella and besides it is busted and if I
was to buy a new one I should not have no lunch for the
rest of this week and the next. And so I stand in the doorway
of the restaurant waiting for the rain to stop but it
gets worse and I stand till my legs is ready to give away
and the tears is running down my cheeks as bad as the rain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
and gee Mom it is sure awful to be a poor girl and have
only one chance to look decent in your whole life-time and
then see you got to lose that chance.</p>

<p>Well I look around and standing under the awning of the
next store who do you think I see—the feller that has been
shadowing Mr. Edgerton and me! And suddenly I gets red
hot and I goes over to him and I says, “What are you following
me round for?”</p>

<p>Well of course he is rattled and he stammers, “I aint
been following you lady I am waiting for the rain to stop.”</p>

<p>“You husky brute with an umbrella and rubber shoes on?”
I says. “Go and tell that to the judge,” I says. “What is
it you want out of me?”</p>

<p>Of course he don’t know what to say but suddenly I
make a guess and I says, “Do you want to know where I
live?” I says. “Are you trying to follow me home? If so,”
I says, “I’ll make you a bargain you lend me them rubbers
to put over my new shoes and you put that there umbrella
over my new hat and dress and you can walk home with me
as straight as the streets run.”</p>

<p>And gee Mom he is tickled so that he busts out laughing.
It seems that he is a good sport because he says “All right
Miss if you really mean it I’ll take you up.” And he
reaches down and takes off his rubbers.</p>

<p>But before I stoop to put them on I gives him a good look
in the eye and I says, “Look here Mr. Man I want you to
understand that I’m a lady and if you try to get fresh with
me I’ll poke you in the mug with your own umbrella,” I says.</p>

<p>And he says, “Oh no ma’am it aint anything like that,” he
says. “I am a respectable married man and you are quite
safe with me.” And so he escorts me home and bids me
good-night at the door as polite as if I was the daughter of
an admiral or of some famous diplomat like Mr. Edgerton
says that I look. And what it is that he’s after well I suppose
I’ll know about it someday when it has happened.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LETTER_X">LETTER X</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">IN WHICH I TAKE A FLOP</p>


<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mom</span>:<br>
</p>

<p>I have your letter and also Pop’s and I dont wonder you
both find it fearful exciting to get my letters telling how I
have told Mr. Edgerton what to tell the Spokesman to say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
to the American people and then that same day to get the
newspaper and see that He has said exactly what I have
said for Him to say. And just think Mom it is not only in
the Camden Republican that you would read it but if you
would of been in Philadelphia then you would of saw it in
the Philadelphia Democrat and it would of been the same
in Oshkosh or Lalipalousa wherever them places is.</p>

<p>Indeed Mr. Edgerton says it would be the same if you
was to be in France or in Japan or any of them European
countries because you see we have got more money than
all of them put together and they all have to borrow from
us and so they are all waiting round scared to see what we
are doing and if the Spokesman has et too many pancakes
for His breakfast and they have not agreed with Him then
there is factories got to shut down in South America but
if the Spokesman has just had a visit with a congressman
from back in the hog-belt to tell Him that the hicks is
happy over the increase in their bank mortgages why then
the Spokesman perks up and oil promoters in the Faro
Islands decides that it is all right to drill another well.</p>

<p>Yes it is a most wonderful thing to have happened to a
poor manicure girl from the Elite Beauty Parlors and Mr.
Edgerton is a good and true man and it is almost like
what you might call a platonic friendship. It is extra wonderful
right now because there was the greatest Man in the
whole world miserable and not able to think about international
affairs at all because all the papers was making fun
of Him because He had got a camelephant to exercise His
liver. And I was the one that fixed it up all right with my
idea about the economy stories.</p>

<p>Of course you will of saw them by now. Mr. Edgerton
and the Spokesman did not change a word of what I said.
The Spokeslady is not to get no new Easter hat but is making
Her old one over and the Spokesman Himself is getting
one spring suit that is to cost Him only sixty-five dollars.
I suppose that Mr. Edgerton and the Spokesman knows
about what is the right price but it seems an awful lot of
money to me I know that Pop never paid more than half
that for a suit at least if he did he had the senst never to
let you find it out. I think it is a little hard for great and
rich folks like Mr. Edgerton and the Spokesman to remember
how it is to be real poor. They have left that job to
me and so I don’t worry that my underwear is all darns
and patches because it reminds me that I am keeping close
to the heart of the plain people all the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>Them stories was published only yesterday but already
you can see that they have changed the whole tone of the
papers. In the one I get there is a very respectful editorial,
saying that it is a providential thing for the country in this
age of jazz and flappers to have a great Leader that is a
believer in the pioneer virtue of thrift. And Florabelle her
that works next to me in the Elite Beauty Parlors she says,
“Well, if the Spokeslady can stand it I suppose I can so I
will save the price of a new hat and I can see fifteen or
twenty shows with it,” she says and so you can see what a
great influence I am having even with the Floradumbelles.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>P. S. Well Mom, I am very much puzzled for I have
just got this afternoon’s papers and there is another story
about the Spokesman and the Spokeslady and it contradicts
every word of the other story because it says now that the
Spokeslady has got Herself three especially beautiful new
Easter hats and far from getting along with only one sixty-five
dollar suit of spring clothes the fact is that the Spokesman
has just bought Himself a dozen suits of spring clothes
that cost a hundred and twenty-five dollars each.</p>

<p>And it is a story that seems to be give out from the big
white house just like all the other stories that Mr. Edgerton
has had charge of and I don’t see what it can mean because
it will ruin everything I have done and what are the
plain people going to think when they see one story one day
and then exactly the opposite the next day they will stop believing
anything they read in the papers and how will the
Spokesman be able to instruct them in what they had ought
to do?</p>

<p>I am terrible worried about it because what can I think
except that some of them Bolshiviki fellers has got in their
dirty work somewheres undermining American institutions
and spoiling the work that I am doing for the Spokesman?
I am on pins and needles waiting for Mr. Edgerton to call
again and hope it will be soon. I am not allowed to call
him because of course it would not do for him to be making
dates with ladie’s voices over the telephone at the big white
house where the Spokesman speaks.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>P. S. Again. Well it is another day and I have not heard
from Mr. Edgerton and it is a shame there had surely
ought to of been some way that I could get hold of him in
a time of public danger like this. It seems to me like the
Reds is running away with the country and I could not sleep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
good all night I dreamed that I seen twelve Spokesmen all
alike riding around on twelve electric camels and each one
of Them had on a hundred and twenty-five dollar suit of
clothes. And there is an editorial in the paper this morning
saying that of course it is necessary for the Spokesman to
be clad adequate to His high Station and of course He
would not be stingy to His wife at this joyous Eastertide.
And Floradumbelle says she guesses she will have to have
her new hat after all and she will stick some gentleman
friend for her movie tickets so you can see how the whole
country is getting demoralized again.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>P. S. Once More. Well Mr. Edgerton called up and I
met him at the restaurant but he was scared to speak to me
he is being shadowed all the time by these mysterious
enemies. He signed for me to follow him and I seen that
something was wrong so I followed and we dodged about
a while till we was sure there was nobody following and
then he went to a big art gallery and we sat there and talked.
He said that was a private enough place because nobody
that had to do with politics in Washington would ever go
into no place like an art gallery.</p>

<p>Well I have found about the stories and what went wrong.
He says that my economy stories was the awfulest flop that
ever had went out from the great white house and it has
put him in the awfulest hole and most ruined him with the
Spokesman. He says it was not the Bolshivikis at all but
it was the business men no sooner did they see that story in
the papers than they run bear-headed and wild-eyed to the
nearest telegraft office and in the first two hours they had a
hundred and forty-seven telegrams of protest mostly from
millinery manufacturers and associations of cloak and suit
dealers and they all wanted to know whether the Spokesman
had gone mad or was the Bolshivikis conspiring to get Him
to ruin the retail trade of the country. Here the Spokesman
had promised them prosperity and they had put up I
forget how many millions to elect Him, and now He goes
and gives them this jab in the solar plexus.</p>

<p>And Mr. Edgerton says it was something awful the panic
in the big white house because the Spokesman had gone out
for a walk with His four secret service men that is hired
to pull Him out from under automobiles and they couldn’t
find Him and they begun telephoning to places on the way
to look for Him and so there was a report that the Bolshivikis
had blowed Him up and somebody called out all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
fire-engines in the city. But at last they got hold of Him
and the contradiction was sent out quick but not before
eleven manufacturers in the Eastern states alone had gone
into bankruptcy and that is why they had to make it a dozen
suits the Spokesman had bought in the hope to save the
wholesale trade.</p>

<p>And Mr. Edgerton says that poor Mr. Grandaddy Prows
sent a heart-broken cablegram from the ship that he is sailing
on to Europe because he is sure that it is an effort to
ruin the department-store business and to punish him because
he let the camelephant out of the stable. And
Senator Buttles is furious too because he makes linings for
ladies hats in one of his mills but he is glad too because
he hates Mr. Edgerton because he can’t bear to have nobody
but him telling the Spokesman what to say to the American
people. But Mr. Edgerton says what would Senator Buttles
know to say because he has got only one idea in the whole
world and that is a ten percent reduction in the wages of his
mill-hands.</p>

<p>Gee Mom it is terrible to be in a mix-up like this I had no
idea that high life was so complicated and for the first time
I am doubting whether I am big enough for my job. Just
think of it to save the situation they have had to send out
another story to say that the cost of keeping up the Spokesman’s
private yacht that is really a ship of the navy is two
hundred thousand dollars a year and so everybody can see
that He lives like a Gentleman of His high Station had ought
to do.</p>

<p>Well I seen that Mr. Edgerton was so blue I hated to
tell him any more troubles but I thought that he should
know about how I had spoke to that feller that has been
following us and how he had walked home with me. I said
that some time the feller would of been bound to of found
out where I lived and Mr. Edgerton said that was right.
And he said that he would not give a whoop about it because
the truth was he was sick of his job and anybody that
wanted it could have it for the price of ten cents. And he
would go and get a job with some big business where a
feller could do what he pleased and not have somebody snooping
on him all the time. Of course I tried to cheer him up
I told him how he must think about the plain people and he
said something about the plain people that was not nice for
a lady to hear and him sitting right in front of one of them
Eyetalian madonnas in the art-gallery too.</p>

<p>I went home very sad and lonely and without no dinner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
and gee Mom what should I run into at home? Mrs. Budd
that is my landlady must of been watching for me for she
come running out and of course I was scared I wonder if
I will ever get so that I do not jump when I see a landlady
coming at me. But it wasn’t to get her money this time
but to tell me that there has been a lady here looking for
me about a half an hour ago.</p>

<p>“A lady?” I says. “What sort of a lady?”</p>

<p>“A large soft lady,” she says, “a real sure enough one
a swell looker.”</p>

<p>“And didn’t she leave no name?”</p>

<p>“No,” says Mrs. Budd, “she said she would come back
again.”</p>

<p>And suddenly something hits me and I says, “How was
she dressed?” She says that she had on a long squirrel-skin
coat that must of cost a thousand dollars and gee Mom it
most floored me for of course it must be Mr. Edgerton’s
wife. And of course that is what that feller was following
me home for and he has told her where I live and she has
come after me. And gee I feel like I was Lydia Lovelight—do
you remember how pathetic she was in “Passion’s Prey?”
But do you really suppose that crazy woman can be after me
with a gun because she thinks that I have took her husband
away from her? I says to myself, “Mamie Riggs
you have wished that you could get to Hollywood and
now its seems that Hollywood is come to you!” Well, if
anything happens you will see it in the papers.</p>

<p class="ph3">IN WHICH I PLAY A BIG SCENE</p>


<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mom</span>:<br>
</p>

<p>Well I hate to be writing you blue letters and you having
such a hard time what with the baby having the croup and
Pop not sure of his job. Tell him I thank him for his fine
ideas but the truth is just now I have not got no heart for
the work I have been trying to do it seems to me like I had
better just be a plain manicure girl like I used to be and not
try to understand these great world affairs that is too much
for my poor head.</p>

<p>The reason is because it don’t seem to me like people was
honest like I thought they was. When I told Mr. Edgerton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
to have the Spokesman give out to the newspapers all them
stories about Him and the Spokeslady being so economical
and not buying no new clothes I thought They was really going
to not do it and it was all going to be straight. But the
way Mr. Edgerton talked They just didn’t bother about the
truth at all and it has made me sort of ashamed. If They
are going to do things that way I just aint interested in helping
Them at all because They are really not doing the plain
people no good.</p>

<p>Of course I aint had no chance to ask Mr. Edgerton about
it because he aint called me up again so I am just waiting.
The girls in the Elite Beauty Parlors they seen I had something
on my mind and Ada Huggins, she says, “What’s the
matter Mame you seem sort of deestraight.” You see since
she has changed her name to Adaire she is always trying to
use French words and I do sure hate affected people.</p>

<p>I says, “I have got important matters to occupy my mind
and I have not got no time for idle chatter,” I says. And
she says, “Well now will you listen to that, of all the airs!
Who do you think you are the Spokesman up in the big white
house?” “You are getting warm,” I says but of course I
didn’t say no more because it is what Mr. Edgerton calls a
state secret that I am helping him.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>P. S. Well, I went home thinking about that mysterious
lady that has been to call on me and that I am pretty
sure is Mrs. Edgerton. And Mrs. Budd my landlady
says she aint come again. She is awful curious about
such a great lady coming to see a girl that has got the
cheapest room in her house and she says, “Is it some lost
aunt of yours dearie?” But I says, “It is just a friend I
think.”</p>

<p>She says, “You could talk to her in my parlor if you like.”
And of course I know that is just so that she can listen in
but what can I do can I expect a visitor to climb four
flights of stairs and where could I put her in this room that
is only six by eight and I have to shove the oil stove and
what is left of my dinner under the bed before I can get to
the door. So I says, “Thank you very kindly.” And she
says, “I will call you if she comes and you can come down.”
I says, “Do please and keep her entertained while I am getting
my curl-papers off.”</p>

<p>You see I wanted to fix myself as decent as I could so
as not to shame Mr. Edgerton too much for knowing me.
So I wash my face and put my hair up to curl and I get my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
supper of potato chips and pickles in a hurry and I am just
in the middle of getting it down with my new dress I have
took off all over the bed when I hear a step in the hall and
there comes a knock on the door and I think of course it is
Mrs. Budd and I says, “Come in,” and the door opens and
my God there she is!</p>

<p>Well Mom you could of knocked me over with an orange
stick. I just stand there with half a dill pickle in my mouth
and the other half in my hand and stare at her like a boob.
It is the same lady that I seen getting out of the electric
coop with Mr. Edgerton and she has got on the same squirrel-skin
coat and all. She wouldn’t have to be a very big
lady to seem awful big standing in the doorway and she is
red from climbing the stairs and there is red in her eyes
too she gives me the glare and holds herself stiff and straight
and gee Mom I feel like a worm must feel when it is going
to be stepped on.</p>

<p>“Are you Miss Mamie Riggs?” she says and I gives a gulp
at the pickle. “And so you are the woman that is going
with my husband!” she says.</p>

<p>So then I see it is going to be a war and I thinks what
kind? She has got me penned in a corner and there is just
a window and no fire-escape and a long ways to the ground
and she has got a big squirrel-skin muff that she holds in her
left hand with her hand inside it and I thinks to myself there
is your death Mamie Riggs because of course she must have
a gun in that hand and gee Mom it sure makes your hair rise
up to watch that muff and wonder what is going to happen
will she let the muff fall and show the gun or will she shoot
through the muff? But no she won’t be apt to do that because
she won’t think no manicure girl worth spoiling a fine
muff over. It is exactly like the big scene in a play you know
how it is Mom only you really don’t because it is another
thing altogether when it is real.</p>

<p>Well I have got the pickle out of the way and so I say
real careful like, “I have the honor to be a friend of Mr.
Edgerton,” I says. And then I have a sudden bright idea
and I raise my voice and call, “Come in Mrs. Budd.” Then
I listen and I say again louder yet, “Please come in Mrs.
Budd.” For of course I know that she is not going to lose
her chance to find out what is going on but will be at the
door listening and sure enough the door opens kind of timid
and I hear her voice behind the big lady, “Did you call me
Miss Riggs?”</p>

<p>“You might come in,” I says. “I have a lady caller she is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
the wife of a gentleman friend of mine. Meet Mrs. Edgerton,”
I says, “Mrs. Budd.”</p>

<p>And Mrs. Budd gives a courtsey that is not answered being
that she is behind and aint saw and so I sweep my clothes
into a heap and I says, “Come and sit on the bed,” I says.
And so of course Mrs. Edgerton has to let her get by and sit
down and then I feel a little better because my landlady is
between us and I think maybe if there should trouble start
she might shove her hand up or rattle her and spoil her aim.</p>

<p>But I have made a bum guess from seeing too many
movies I guess for it aint anything like that. All of a sudden
the lady lets her muff drop and puts her two hands up
to her face white kid gloves and all and busts into tears!
And there she stands shaking and sobbing and says to herself,
“Oh the shame of it, the shame of it!”</p>

<p>So then of course I remember that she is supposed to be
a sick woman and what she is going through and I am
sorry and I says, “Look here Mrs. Edgerton you have got
this all wrong things between your husband and me aint at
all what you think,” I says.</p>

<p>So then she flares all hot again and drops her hands. “Do
you mean to say you have not been going to dinners with
my husband all the time?”</p>

<p>“It would be very silly of me to deny that,” I says,
“seeing that your detective has been sitting at the next table
to us most of the times but what is the harm of dinners?”</p>

<p>“And him with a wife at home!” she says with the tears
running down her cheeks again. “And the dinner on the
table getting cold!”</p>

<p>“Well that is too bad,” I says, “it was a shame to waste
so many dinners but I didn’t know about that Mrs. Edgerton,”
I says. “A gentleman asked me to dinner and being
hungry why shouldn’t I go?”</p>

<p>Well I see she is human after all and I am still more
sorry so I goes on real friendly like. “I guess Mrs. Edgerton
you have not knowed many working girls in your life,”
I says, “and you aint realized how it feels when a gentleman
offers you a dinner free of charge. They pay me
eighteen-fifty a week at the Elite Beauty Parlors and I have
got to live on that till the next Saturday night and if I have
not got anything left on Friday night I do not have any
dinner,” I says. “Mrs. Budd here will tell you that I have
to give her six dollars a week that is what a girl has to pay
to keep the rain off her in Washington D. C. And if I spend
a dollar a day for my food then I have five dollars and a half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
a week to dress myself like my profession requires and all
the luxuries that you see in this room,” I says kind of sarcastic,
“and for tooth-paste and what laundry I can’t do in
the bath-tub downstairs without Mrs. Budd finding it out
and for music and books and art,” I says, “and for doctor’s
bills if I should—” I am just about to say, “If I should take
up the notion that I have got the angina pectoris of the
toe,” but I realize that would be nasty so I end kind of meek-like,
“if I should be sick.”</p>

<p>She is staring and has got a kind of agonized curiosity
in her face like she would like to know what sort of terrible
animal I am. The tears is still there so I says, “What is it
you believe, Mrs. Edgerton? Do you think I have been paying
the woman’s price for my dinners?” I says. “Well it has
been winter time and cold outside and where do you think
I could of took him to? Would I bring him to this room?”
I says. “If you think that just you ask Mrs. Budd here
and she will show you down the stairs quick,” I says. And
of course Mrs. Budd gives a snort and I says, “Do you run
that sort of a house Mrs. Budd?” And she says, “Not
that I know of!”</p>

<p>So there is a little pause and the lady still weeping silent
so I goes on, “Has that dick been telling you lies so as to
keep his job lady? If he has told you the truth it is this
that I have et maybe a dozen dinners at your husband’s expense
and I have walked a little ways on the street with him
and sat once talking in an art-gallery and that is all. I have
not even been into a taxi-cab with him and he left his own
car at home for his wife or that is what he told me and if it
aint true it is not my fault. And if it is the cost of the dinners
that worries you it would of been easier to of saved all
the money you must of paid to that there dick,” I says. “It
was mostly in cheap places that we et because he was scared
he would be saw.”</p>

<p>“And if you are so innocent why do you have to hide?”
she cries.</p>

<p>“He said he had to Mrs. Edgerton and when a gentleman
asks you to dinner at a cheap place you can’t hint for
a better place at least not if you are a lady. I shouldn’t
wonder if the reason was because he had a wife that he
thought wasn’t reasonable and wouldn’t believe the truth if
he told it to her.”</p>

<p>“But why does my husband have to dine with a woman I
do not meet?”</p>

<p>“You will not like it,” I says, “if I tell you that you and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
your lady friends can’t give your husband what he has to
have in his political life. But you had ought to see it because
you would scorn to know the things that his job requires
him to know.”</p>

<p>“What things?”</p>

<p>“Things about the way the plain people of this country
feel and what they want.”</p>

<p>“A manicure girl!” she kind of snorts.</p>

<p>“There is a lot of us,” I says, “and it aint only that we
have got votes but we do a lot of talking and can be a
political force if you get us real mad,” I says. “And then
there’s Pop,” I says, “a gas-house worker in Camden New
Jersey and if anybody was to ask you what such a man would
say about the League of Nations for instance would you
have any idea what to answer? No Mrs. Edgerton you
wouldn’t but right there on my dressing table underneath
the cold cream jar is a letter about it that I was intending
to read to Mr. Edgerton the next time I meet him.”</p>

<p>Well she looks me over some more and then she says in
what is meant to be icy tones of voice, “Why could his wife
not attend these political conferences?”</p>

<p>“Indeed she could so far as I am concerned Mrs. Edgerton
I have never had a word to tell to your husband that you
might not of listened in on.”</p>

<p>So she thinks again and says, “It is a shame that there
should be two dinners and one should wait and get cold,”
she says.</p>

<p>“Yes ma’am,” I says. “I can see that is a waste.”</p>

<p>But her next one floors me. “Will you come to dine at
my home Miss Riggs?” she says real sweet.</p>

<p>So then I have to think in a hurry. “What is that Mrs.
Edgerton?” I says. “Are you expecting to make a boob out
of me?”</p>

<p>“You have political information to give my husband,” she
says, “and when a woman’s husband is in political life it is
the custom for her to give dinner-parties to help his career.
I invite you to dine with us.”</p>

<p>And so I gives a gulp like I had another pickle in my
throat and I says, “Very well ma’am I will come.”</p>

<p>“And when?” says she. “The sooner the better will you
come tomorrow evening?”</p>

<p>“I have no other date,” I says.</p>

<p>So she stoops down and picks up her muff and in it she
has got not a pistol but a vanity case. Her fingers is
trembling so that she can hardly open it but she does and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
there is a gold pencil and a little note-book and she puts it
against the wall and writes the address 2349 Alexander
Hamilton Place Thursday at 7.30 and she hands it to me.
“There it is and I hope you will not disappoint us.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Edgerton,” I says, “you must understand I have not
got no good clothes for such a party—”</p>

<p>“Pray,” she says, “don’t give a thought to that. This is
to be an intellectual and political occasion and you may wear
your street dress that my husband has bought you,” she
says, “and I will wear the same kind that he has bought
me.”</p>

<p>And so then she sweeps out and leaves Mrs. Budd and I
to spend the rest of the night talking it over. And gee Mom
when I thought about her I had made up my mind that I
would count it a victory if I got off without a bullet in me
and here now I have got another free dinner coming!</p>

<p class="ph3">IN WHICH I MISS HALF A DINNER</p>


<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mom</span>:<br>
</p>

<p>I have just got back from Mrs. Edgerton’s party and I
have sure got some news now.</p>

<p>How I did wished I could of had you here to advise with.
The best guess I could make was that Mrs. Edgerton was
figuring to show her husband the difference between a real
lady and a manicure girl but Mrs. Budd she says “Maybe
she really wants to know you because why,” she says, “if a
woman’s husband is got to talk about politics with manicure
girls any wife would rather it was where she could be
around.” But I think Mrs. Budd must of been impressed by
that squirrel-skin coat for of course any landlady will trust
you more if you have got a thing like that on.</p>

<p>Well anyhow I says that I am going there and do the best
I know how and talk with Mr. Edgerton just the same as
all the other times. Because after all the main thing is that
he has got this great work to do to tell the Spokesman what
to say to the whole American people. He has ast me to
advise him and I am not going to let no jealous wife scare
me off.</p>

<p>I have not got time to get home to fix myself up after
work so I give myself a lick and a promise in the beauty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
parlors and pile myself into a street car and get pretty much
mussed up in the crowd and I ride until I get to Alexander
Hamilton Place. But then it is too early and I have read
in the etiquette book that it is not good form to arrive for
dinners ahead of time so I take a little walk though I don’t
mind admitting to my dear old Mom that my knees is kind of
weak for walking. But I am not scared in the head and I
think up some good conversation and remember some ideas
in Pop’s letters and so I go back to the house.</p>

<p>It is one of these gosh-almighty swell apartment-houses
made out of pink and green marble and red plush curtains
and palm trees and colored boys with brass buttons. But I
have got my new clothes and I am not going to worry even
if Mrs. Edgerton does know that her husband bought them
for me. I am announced by the telephone and I ride up in
the elevator and there comes a maid with a white apron and
a cap and I am took into a dressing room and then a room
with a piano and some books and lights that is dim and
mysterious.</p>

<p>Well I have had the hope that I might see Mr. Edgerton
first so as to get a line on what is coming but she don’t
mean to give me no such advantage she comes sweeping in.
“Good evening Miss Riggs,” she says and I remember that
the etiquette books says that some ladies shake hands and
some do not and she is one of them that does not. She is
very polite but a little too gushy and I says to myself right
off Mamie Riggs she is worse scared than you are.</p>

<p>Well she starts to tell about the late winter we are having
and of course I know as much about the weather as anybody
and after we have finished with winter in Washington D. C.
I tell her about winter in Camden New Jersey.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Edgerton comes in and he is the same old friend
and we do shake hands and like we meant it and then I see
that he is going to play the game like there wasn’t nothing
wrong. So I says, “Well Mr. Edgerton and how goes the
economy program with the Spokesman?”</p>

<p>He says, “Well it is not going so good as it might because
you know how it is with economy it is a fine word
for the campaign but when you come to put it into practice
you find that it means letting somebody out of a job and it
always turns out to be the third cousin of some congressman
or maybe of a district leader.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I says, “some of them fellers that is setting with
their feet up on their desks smoking long cigars.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” he says, “and there is nothing that worries the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
Spokesman so much as thinking about them fellers. You
see how it is when it comes to election time they are all busy
rustling out the vote for Him and after that He has got to
find something for them to do.”</p>

<p>Well I had thought I must be careful not to leave Mrs.
Edgerton out of this conversation so I says, “A little while
ago, Mrs. Edgerton I thought I understood about this here
economy business but now I find it is complicated and there
is something that Mr. Edgerton or maybe yourself might
explain.”</p>

<p>“And what is that?” she says.</p>

<p>“Well it is this business that you can never economize in
nothing without turning somebody out of work. But it is
a terrible thing for working people to be out of jobs,” I
says, “right now my Pop is scared that he may lose his job
at the gas-works and him with a half a dozen kids growing
up and why should them kids have to starve just because
some people is took it into their heads to economize on gas-bills?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we had better go in to the table,” says Mrs.
Edgerton and so there is the dining room and gee Mom if
you could see how them people live they are surely making
jobs for the poor. The table is all got a solid piece of glass
over the whole top and there is a centre-piece that is hand-embroidered
lace and you have got a hand-embroidered doily
in front of your place and there is real silver and what I
guess is cut-glass and there is little electric candles at each
place and there is two sorts of wine glasses well Mom all I
can say is that I am glad I have took your advice and
studied the etiquette books and practiced them so that now
I do not have to be rattled but can give my thoughts to being
intellectual.</p>

<p>Well we have got started on some oyster cocktails and I
says, “Have you thought up any way to undo them blunders
of ours and get the people to liking the Spokesman
again?” And he says, “No I have not.”</p>

<p>And so I says, “I have been thinking hard about it and
I have been looking at the pictures of the Spokesman that I
see in the papers and it seems to me they are wrong. Have
you ever thought about them?” “No,” he says, “I can’t
say that I have what is it?”</p>

<p>And so I tell him, “They are all pictures that is took in
regular clothes like a business Man with a white collar and
one of them hundred and twenty-five dollars suits on. But
the most of the people in this country don’t look like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
fashion model,” I says, “and they don’t wear white collars except
on Sunday and the Fourth of July. It seems to me
they would be a lot more interested in listening to the
Spokesman’s advice about how to live their lives if they
thought He lived the same kind of lives that they do.”</p>

<p>So he sits very thoughtful and he says, “That might be a
worthwhile idea,” he says. “What would you suggest Miss
Riggs?”</p>

<p>“Well,” I says, “what was it that the Spokesman done
when He was young back there in the State of North Carolina?”</p>

<p>“North Carolina?” says he. “You mean Vermont, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Well I can never keep them states straight,” I says. “I
knew it was up in the North somewhere, but what was it
He done?”</p>

<p>“Well He was raised on a farm.”</p>

<p>“All right then that is fine there is still lots of farmers in
this country I guess. So why don’t He go up there to the
old homestead and get some pictures took while He is
pitching the hay?”</p>

<p>“You are a little ahead of time,” says Mr. Edgerton. “I
am afraid they have still got snow on that homestead up
there.”</p>

<p>“Well then let Him go shovel the snow it will do just as
good.”</p>

<p>“He is hardly a husky enough Man for snow-shovelling,”
says Mr. Edgerton.</p>

<p>“That is all right,” I says, “it don’t take long to get a
picture not even a movie,” I says. “The point is that the
plain people can see the Spokesman with His coat and collar
off and looking like them. I know how it is with my
own Pop if he was to see a picture of the Spokesman in a
pair of blue overalls and a big wrench in His hand and it
was headed the Spokesman mends His own gas pipe up there
at the big white house why I know that Pop would vote for
Him till the water-pipes bust in hell,” I says.</p>

<p>And so then Mr. Edgerton is excited and he says he believes
that is the solution of the problem the way for him
to get back into favor and put Senator Buttles into the discard.
And we go on talking about what is to be in these
pictures I can’t remember all we said but it was like that
and I may be awful dumb but I honestly thought it was an
intellectual conversation. But I have got so interested that
I guess I must of forgot to bring Mrs. Edgerton in. Anyhow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
we have et some soup and we are eating some fish and
I am talking hard when suddenly I hears the wife give a
sniff and I looks and she is sitting very straight and her face
is got bright and it seems she is hopping mad and all of a
sudden up she hops with her napkin in her hand and cries,
“Oh this is intolerable!”</p>

<p>Of course I stares and I says, “Why Mrs. Edgerton!”</p>

<p>She says, “You are making a fool of me both of you!”</p>

<p>I says bewildered like, “Why ma’am what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“You really expect me to believe such rubbish?” she
cries.</p>

<p>“Well ma’am,” I says. “It may be rubbish but it seems
like good political business to me. I don’t understand you
at all.”</p>

<p>But she only gets redder and madder so that she can
hardly talk but only sort of gasp and she says looking at
her husband, “To bring her into my home to mock at me!
The shame of it!”</p>

<p>Says Mr. Edgerton very cold, “You invited her here and
you undertook to behave yourself.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” she says, “I can’t stand it I can’t stand it!” And
suddenly she busts into tears and clasps her napkin to her
eyes and rushes out of the room and there the two of us is
left staring at each other.</p>

<p>“Well Mr. Edgerton,” I says, “I am very much puzzled
about this because what have I done?”</p>

<p>“You have not done nothing,” he says.</p>

<p>“Is it that she thinks I have been too familiar talking about
the Spokesman like He was one of us plain people?”</p>

<p>But he says no that is not it. “The truth is Miss Riggs I
have not been able to persuade my wife that you and I are
seriously interested in public questions and so when you sit
and talk about helping me it seems to her that we are playing
a game to make her ridiculous.”</p>

<p>“Oh that is it!” I says. “But does she not know that this
is a free country and that I have got a vote the same as she
has?”</p>

<p>“You are perfectly right,” he says, “and let us go on with
our conversation and our dinner.”</p>

<p>But of course I am not hungry no more I have got
some self-respect for all my needing a meal and I says,
“No Mr. Edgerton it will have to be some other time because
I don’t think I had ought to stay in this house it
would only be making your wife angrier than ever.”</p>

<p>First he tries to stop me but then he says that he will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
drive me home—imagine him taking me in that electric coop
that he drives her in! I says, “No Mr. Edgerton it will
not be the first time that I have gone home in a street car
and I will do it once more,” I says.</p>

<p>“But Miss Riggs,” he says, “am I to lose your political
counsel?”</p>

<p>“No,” I says, “you can phone me tomorrow but right now
I want you to go in and see your wife and try to fix it up
with her,” I says, “and not make her no madder by taking
me home alone.” And so I make him get my things and I
walk home and gee Mom all the way I am thinking I will
never know what was going to be the rest of that dinner!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="LETTER_XIII">LETTER XIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">IN WHICH I MISS ANOTHER HALF DINNER</p>


<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mom</span>:<br>
</p>

<p>Of course I was on pins and needles all day waiting for
Mr. Edgerton to call me so as I could find out what had
happened between him and his wife. And just when I
was done work and ready to go out of the beauty parlor he
phoned and gee then I had to break a date with Adaire Huggins
to go to a show with her and all the girls is getting
more and more sorer because I am so up-stage with them
having an affair with a gentleman and not telling them
nothing.</p>

<p>Well Mr. Edgerton took me to the Chink place again and
we et some more chop-guey and there was no detective
watching us and we had a good chat. And he says that Mrs.
Edgerton is so angry she says she will never speak to him
again, and then she tells him that she is going to write to the
Spokesman about how her husband is taking a manicure girl
to dinners with him and pretending that this girl gives him
the ideas that the Spokesman has to say to all the newspaper
reporters of the whole world. And of course if she
does that it will mean that Mr. Edgerton will be out of his
job because of course the Spokesman is a very moral man
and therefore somewhat suspicious and it would not be possible
to persuade Him that it was just for my ideas that
Mr. Edgerton was taking me to dinner and anyhow if it was
true it would be worse because it would insult Him to know
where His ideas comes from.</p>

<p>And so Mr. Edgerton is very much worried and I says
to him, “Do you really think that she will do such a mean
thing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>He says, “I do not know for is it possible to say what
a woman will do when she is very angry?”</p>

<p>I says, “Yes it is possible,” I says, “if you do not mind
answering me a very personal question.”</p>

<p>“What is that Miss Riggs?”</p>

<p>“Will you tell me whether Mrs. Edgerton has got any
money of her own?”</p>

<p>“No she has not.”</p>

<p>“Then Mr. Edgerton,” I says, “you may rest quite easy
for she is not going to say a word to the Spokesman nor to
anyone else that will tell because don’t you see that if she
done that she would be throwing her bread and butter in the
mud?” I says.</p>

<p>“But she is frightfully angry Miss Riggs almost hysterical.”</p>

<p>“That is all right,” I says. “But when a woman gets
hysterical she always keeps one corner of her brains that
knows what she is doing and why. Mrs. Edgerton has got
a swell apartment and an electric coop and a squirrel-skin
coat and all them things is very nice and what is making her
angry is the idea that I am getting a part of them away
from her. But that is not going to make her give up the
rest,” I says.</p>

<p>“Really now,” he says, “you are too cynical about
women.”</p>

<p>“No,” I says, “but women have had to get what they
have got from men and they have had to learn how. But
maybe these is things that it is not right for women to tell
to men so if you do not mind I will talk to you about the
Spokesman and what He thinks about my idea that He
should have a lot of pictures took showing Himself as a
farmer’s Boy back on the old homestead.”</p>

<p>Well he tells me that he has talked about the idea with the
Spokesman who is very much enthused about it and thinks
it will be a great publicity stunt. And He is going to send
up word for them to water the hay on the old place and grow
it just as quick as they can and when it is high enough He
will take His private train with about a hundred newspaper
reporters up there and they can take pictures of the great
Man riding a hayrake and that will surely be better than
riding a camelephant. And Mr. Edgerton says he has
spoke to the reporters also and they are keen about it and
one of them has got the promise of a picture of the Spokesman
with His arm about His favorite cow that He milked
when He was a boy and when the general manager of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
Amalgamated Press Association or something like that got
wind about what they was planning he telegraphed for a life-size
picture of the Spokesman leading old Dobbin home from
the pasture.</p>

<p>Mr. Edgerton says it is a shame that hay grows so late in
them artic regions and there is no way you can imitate it in
a motion picture studio. And then I says, “Look-a-here
Mr. Edgerton,” I says, “I have got a crow to pick with you
and now is the time.”</p>

<p>“Did you get it out of the chop-guey?” he says because
of course he is feeling jolly over that idea I have give him
and what a blow it will be to Senator Buttles that grew up
in a town and went to a college and is no good at all for
the old homestead stuff.</p>

<p>“But this is no joke,” I says. “I have had it in mind ever
since you sent out that story about the Spokesman buying a
dozen spring suits to help the wholesale clothing trade.
What I want to know is has He honestly bought them?”</p>

<p>“Well Miss Riggs,” he says, “I think we can feel reasonably
certain that He has because he is fifty-three years old
and He surely must of bought a spring suit every four years
of His life.”</p>

<p>“That may be,” I says, kind of shocked, “but that is not
what anybody is going to make out of that story Mr. Edgerton
it was meant to be took that He had bought all them
suits this year. And what I have got to say to you is I
have always been brought up to tell the truth and I thought
that I was helping to get the truth told to the plain people
and if them that is in charge is all cynical about it then I
could not be happy and I would rather have nothing to do
with it.”</p>

<p>Well Mom he sees that I am serious and he says again
that I am just like the Spokesman I have a natural deep
reverence for great ideals and that is why I am able to understand
Him so good. I says, “Yes but then why does He let
you give out stories about Him that is not true?”</p>

<p>He thinks for a while and then he says, “Miss Riggs I am
going to explain something to you that at first you may find
hard to understand. There is a difference between public
life and other life and there is a kind of truth for each. I
think maybe it will be easier for you to understand because
you tell me that your mother was once an actress.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I says, “she was a great actress she played Eliza in
Uncle Tom’s Cabin for many years.”</p>

<p>“Well,” he says, “then you must of been to plays and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
maybe behind the scenes and you know that a play can be
true as a play and yet it don’t have to be true in other
ways. For instance suppose your mother is playing the part
of a young girl well she makes up that way and she pretends
to be happy and the audience is all delighted and they
get a truth out of that play. But it may be that really your
mother is older and has got children at home and one of
them has got the croup—I believe you told me one of them
had—and your mother is not feeling happy that night at all
yet she has got to play that she is happy because that is the
play-truth but if she was to act the real truth and cry on the
stage why she would spoil the show and the audience would
not get the truth of the play at all and they would go home
sore.”</p>

<p>Of course I can see that. But I says, “This that we are
talking about is real life—”</p>

<p>“But are you sure?” he says. “Suppose you was to get
behind the scenes and discover that this game of politics
is another kind of a play and that everybody in it has
got to pretend that they are different from their real
selves.”</p>

<p>Well of course I am kind of stunned and he can see it in
my face and he says, “Does that shock you so much?” he
says. “Don’t you see that the people have got to have
ideals they have got to believe in great men?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I says, “but aren’t there no real great men?”</p>

<p>“There is now and then a great man,” he says, “but he is
very scarce and most generally you will find that he is not
available for Spokesman. There can be a thousand different
reasons maybe he is not acceptable to the Knights of
Columbus or maybe he was born in Kishineff or maybe he
believes in evolution or maybe his wife has divorced him or
maybe none of the big bankers is ever met him. So you
have got to take somebody that has been careful and not
made no enemies and then when you have got him you have
got to do the best you can by him and the daughter of a
famous actress should ought to understand how much a
skillful make-up and the right costumes can do to say
nothing of a highly skilled press agent and a good lady assistant,”
he says with a bow.</p>

<p>But his little compliment don’t help him for I says, “Then
you are all the time fooling the plain people!” I says.</p>

<p>“Miss Riggs,” he says, “you are a serious young lady and
I want you to stop and think what would happen to this
country if the people was to lose their reverence for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
Spokesman that lives up in the big white house and tells
them what to think and what to do?”</p>

<p>Well of course I cant think what would happen but Mr.
Edgerton he says, “Look here I have got a piece out of a
paper from a town in the middle west and there was a man
from that town that come to Washington and he shook the
hand of the Spokesman and then he went back home and when
the word got out that he had actually shook the hand of the
Spokesman the members of his lodge passed a resolution and
they stood him up by the door and every one of the seventy-five
men in the lodge filed by him and shook the hand that had
shook the hand of the Spokesman. And that is what you
call Faith Miss Riggs that is having an ideal and if all them
seventy-five men was to lose it what would happen to them
the whole seventy-five would get drunk and go home and
beat their wives.”</p>

<p>And he goes on, “Yes Miss Riggs,” he says, “it would
mean riot and red revolution. You can go and ask any of
them Bolshivikis if there is anything they would like better
than to have the American people get the idea that the Man
they have got for Spokesman is a poor little Feller with
carroty hair and a sallow skin that suffers from constitutional
timidity and has got where He is by always waiting
for His mind to be made up for Him—just you ask them
Bolshivikis and hear them whoop with delight.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Edgerton,” I says, “you must know I have never
met no Bolshivikis and don’t never expect to.”</p>

<p>“There is a plenty of them,” he says, “right here in Washington
D. C. some of them is in the Senate and I tell you
it puts a grave responsibility on you and me and other loyal
Americans. Because this is what has happened Miss Riggs
right in the middle of the show the leading Gentleman has
went and died and the Understudy has took His place and it
is the most awful job that has ever fell onto a theatrical
management in the entire history of the American drama,”
he says. “Because in this here political play there is no
way that the Understudy can ever have a chance to rehearse
with the rest of the company, one minute He is just a sort
of callboy sitting out on a cracker-box and the next minute
He must put on full regimentals and walk out into the spotlight
and make a speech. And that means Miss Riggs a
most dreadful problem for the rest of the cast that has got
to get behind and support Him and for the stage-directors
and the scene-shifters and worst of all the critics that has
got to write up the show next morning. And that is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
God’s truth about my job and why I have got to have help
so bad and you as a good loyal citizen and the daughter of
a great actress has got to understand me and help with your
great experience.”</p>

<p>Well Mom of course I am floored. All I can do is to sit
there and at last I says, “Mr. Edgerton I have heard what
you tell me and I suppose it is right but I hope you won’t
mind it has shocked me so that I do not think I can eat no
more Chinese dinner,” I says, “but I will go home and think
it over and decide what I can do to help my country.”</p>

<p class="ph3">IN WHICH I GO ON A STRIKE</p>


<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mom</span>:<br>
</p>

<p>I have not saw Mr. Edgerton for three days and I am just
as glad because it has give me time to think things over
and get your letter. You are right I suppose if we cannot
get what we want in this world we have got to make out
with what we have. I know that you would not of chose
to live in the gas-house district of Camden New Jersey if
you could of had your own way nor would I maybe of had
so many brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>Well Mr. Edgerton did not call up. I have noticed that
gentlemen likes to have you pretty and cheerful and if you
take things too serious and worry them with questions they
do not call up so often. But all the same I had to get over
my shock of hearing him say that the work he does for the
Spokesman up there in the big white house is only a sort of
a play and that I have got to get used to the idea of not
telling the truth about the Spokesman. And then too I am
wondering what Mr. Edgerton’s wife is doing and if she is
going to tell on him and me and I am sore because she
should think that because I am a manicure girl I cannot
be fit to know her husband and help him with his politics.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>P. S. Well he has called again and we have went to dinner
and a movie and it was a lovely sweet story called
“Heart’s Athrob” and Mr. Edgerton says to me, “There now
you see Miss Riggs are we not better and purer and sweeter
for having saw such a lovely story about great souls and pitiful
sufferings?” And of course I cannot deny that we are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
for I have got tears in my eyes and he says, “Just such a
beautful picture as that I wish to make for the American
people to look upon and I have got to make it out of that
poor little Man that lives up there in the big white house
and you have got to help me,” he says, “and we will be the
greatest pair of showmen in the whole of creation.”</p>

<p>I says, “Mr. Edgerton I am going to try my best but it
seems to me that all the inspiration goes out of me when I
have been told that it is not the truth. I don’t understand
how it can of happened and I want you to tell me more
about this game of politics how it come about that a Man
like what you say the Spokesman is can of got in such a
high office.”</p>

<p>He says, “It was a series of strange accidents Miss Riggs
like what you would see in a melodrama. To begin with this
little Man was a sort of political Office-boy for the rich men
in his state that put him into office because He would always
do what they said. It is a state with a lot of Catholics in
it and so if you are going to get elected to anything you have
got to learn to walk like you had broken bottles under your
feet and He was the best bottle-walker of them all so He
come to be Governor but then He had a crisis to deal with
there was a strike in the city of the policemen—”</p>

<p>“Policemen?” I says. “But I thought that policemen was
to put down strikes!”</p>

<p>“So it is supposed to be but this time the policemen went
on a strike themselves.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I says, “but that must of been the Reds!”</p>

<p>“So the papers said but the policemen said it was because
they couldn’t live on their wages. You know that policemen
is mostly Irish Catholics that don’t usually go Bolshiviki but
always vote the Democratic ticket and it happened that the
mayor of the city was a Democrat and he fixed it up with
them to give them a raise in wages and the strike was to be
called off. But the bankers and the business men don’t like
no wage-raises because it sets a bad example and so they
went to the Governor and they says, ‘Governor you was
elected on a program of strict economy and law and order
and here this Irish Catholic Democratic son-of-a-sea-cook is
going to get all the votes away from you.’ So they say for
the Governor to break up the settlement and He does it because
the Governor is bigger than the mayor you see. He
goes to the city and Him and the mayor has a meeting in a
hotel-room and the mayor pastes Him one in the eye and
knocks Him down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>“But I thought you said the Governor was bigger!” I says.</p>

<p>“I mean bigger legally. He has got more power.”</p>

<p>“Well then but why didn’t he put the mayor in jail?”</p>

<p>“Well Miss Riggs I will tell you the Spokesman, that was
the Governor He has always been a deeply religious man you
have perhaps noticed in His speeches He tells the people
that the solution of their problems must be found in spirituality.”</p>

<p>“Yes I have saw that,” I says, “and I think it is very
beautiful of Him to say.”</p>

<p>“Well just so Miss Riggs and so when the mayor pastes
Him one in the eye He turns the other eye to him and so
through the rest of the strike He is shut up in His hotel
room. But that don’t matter because the bankers and the
business men take charge and they gets out the college-boys
and smashes the strike with clubs and brick-bats and law
and order is safe. And when the Governor sees that it is
all over He gets out a rousing proclamation in which He
says that He is determined to put down law-breakers and of
course that tickles the newspapers they spread it all over the
front page and the public that don’t know it is over they goes
wild because you know how it was Miss Riggs a few years
ago we was in the middle of smashing the Reds and shipping
them back to the country where they come from seeing they
don’t like this one. And of course the plain people was
scared out of their wits to realize that the Bolshivikis had
been so clever because if Irish Catholic policemen goes Red
who would there be left to stay white?”</p>

<p>“I remember reading about it,” I says, “now that you tell
me and I know I was scared myself.”</p>

<p>“Exactly and this Strong Silent Man He was the One that
had put down the revolution so when the next party convention
come off and the politicians was looking round for
somebody for Vice-Spokesman why here He was and
the convention goes wild and He is nominated in a
whirlwind. And how is anybody going to know that the
Old Spokesman is going to die and leave this scared
little Office-boy the job of telling the American people what
to think?”</p>

<p>“Well Mr. Edgerton,” I says, “I see how it is now of
course and I am very much obliged to you for explaining
and of course I will do the best I can,” I says, “because
whatever happens we have got to hold them Reds down. Of
course I have got no use for labor unions that is just a
bunch of leaders looking for a chance to wear white collars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
and what do they care if they call a strike and the wives
and children has got to go hungry at home?”</p>

<p>“That is it exactly,” he says, “your sound common sense
as usual and it looks as if there was some more strikes coming
and they will try to put them off on the Spokesman,
and you will be the little girl that will know what to tell Him
to say about it.”</p>

<p>Well we are walking home and I am nearly there and I tell
him he had better not go no farther because we don’t know
what his wife may be doing and we have got to be careful so
we shakes hands and parts and I climb up to my hall-bedroom
and I forgot to tell you Mom my landlady has give me
an embroidered splasher that has got a red lily on it to hang
on my wall and it is a lovely decoration she done that because
we have got to be friends since she was there when
Mrs. Edgerton come to see me and insulted me. Well it is
a good thing to be friends with your landlady because some
time when I get stuck for my rent for a few days she will
be more polite with me.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>P. S. Well Mom it is the next day and I have just got
back from the Elite Beauty Parlors and my God I have sure
had a time I don’t know if I will ever go back because we
have had a strike and who do you think was the leader of it
of all people in this world your own Mamie Riggs and what
do you know about that? I will tell you the story right
off.</p>

<p>It was Florabelle that begun it I call her Floradumbelle
but she is got good business sense all the same and she says
to Hattie Schoenstein, “My landlady has raised the rent on
me a dollar a week and what am I going to do must I go
without my lunches?” And Hattie that I have called Hotaire
she says, “And the madame has raised the price of a manicuring
twenty-five cents but what good does that do us?”
And that is no hot air either Mom.</p>

<p>And then Adaire Huggins she says, “Why shouldn’t we
get a raise when everything else is being boosted?” And I
says, “I am with you girls,” and they asks me will I be
the one to do the talking because they seem to think I am
good at it because of my political experience which they
suspect I have had though of course I have not told them
and they have not found out who Mr. Edgerton is.</p>

<p>Well so we go to the private office but it is not so private
because Madame Lafferty lets out a yell and she says, “What
you ask me for more money and when I am on the verge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
of bankruptcy because the landlord is holding me to this
lease that was made in war-time?”</p>

<p>“Us girls is got to live too,” I says, “it is war-time for
us right now.”</p>

<p>“I can get a plenty to do your work for less,” she says.
“And they will be girls that will fix their hair like I tell
them to and they will behave like ladies and not be having
the telephone ringing all day so that my customers do not
know whether I am running a beauty-parlor or a date-ranch.”</p>

<p>Well of course I know that is a slam at me and I am
hot and I says, “All right ma’am,” I says, “and you go and
find them slave-girls right off because I am a free-born
American citizen and I am through,” I says, “and come on
girls let’s get out.” And with that we turns into the parlors
and there is the customers with their fingers half done and
their hair half waved and we shouts to the girls, “It is a
strike we’ll have a dollar extra a week or we quit!”</p>

<p>And they all puts down their things and they shout,
“Strike! Strike!” And the madame she yells, “Out with
you you bunch of hussies!” And we grabs our things and
out we troop and there is a customer coming in and we
says to him it is a gentleman, “This place is closed but two
blocks down the street you will find a beauty parlor where
they pays a living wage to their hands,” we says.</p>

<p>And of course he don’t go in so I says, “We will picket the
old she-devil,” and we begin walking up and down and out
she comes rushing without her hat on and she gets the copper
on the corner and brings him up and she says, “Drive
these hussies away from my door they are ruining my
trade,” she says.</p>

<p>Well the copper he grins kind of good-natured and says,
“Move along now girls.” And I ups I and says, “Officer this
here is a strike,” I says, “and we are picketing this place.”</p>

<p>“Well you will have to move on because you are drawing a
crowd and that is disturbing the peace.”</p>

<p>But I says, “Officer do you mean to tell me that it is the
business of the police to break strikes?” I says. “Is this a
free country or is it Roossia?” But all he says is, “Move
along girls move along,” and he pushes us down the street
and when we try to come back he says he will call a patrol-wagon
and so there we are it is tyranny and injustice, such
as our ancestors rose against but what can we do there is nobody
to take the part of poor working-girls on strike and so
now I am sitting at home and I don’t know if I have got a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
job or not and I shall soon find out whether my landlady is
as much friends with me as my splasher seems to show.</p>

<p class="ph3">IN WHICH I LOSE MY LOVER</p>


<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mom</span>:<br>
</p>

<p>I do hate to write such bad news but you made me promise
I would tell you everything so here it is.</p>

<p>I have not got no job today and the worst of it is I am
the only one that is not. I went back to the Elite Beauty
Parlors this a. m. thinking I was to go on leading the strike
but what do I see but everyone of them girls come up one
by one and try to sneak into the place. I says, “What are
you doing are you going to desert your union and your
class?” And Adaire Huggins she says, “Mame, I am sorry
but I have made a fool out of myself,” and Hotaire Schoenstein
she says, “Mame I have got to eat,” and in they goes
and back to work without no raise in wages and I am left
standing on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>I would not go in if I was to die for it and anyhow I
would only get kicked out because the madame she thinks I
am the cause of that strike. But gee Mom aint it awful to
think how the working-class will throw each other down and
all they would have to do would be to stand together and they
could get anything they want!</p>

<p>Well I go down the street to the La Princesse Beauty
Shoppe but they have got no need for a manicurist, and then
I go to the Betty Blue Rooms and then to the Rosamonde
and the La Belle and the La Coquette and the La Charme
and all the other ones that I have heard of but I think they
must of heard about what I done because they have none
of them got nothing. And gee Mom it is begun to rain and
I am wetting my new clothes and my best shoes is in the
slop and is getting wore down at the heel and I am so blue
I could be made into paint. At last I am clean done up
and come home and flop down on my bed and cry. I have
got only three dollars in my pocket and here I was hoping
to save up so as I could send a little to you!</p>

<p>The worst is I have lost Mr. Edgerton too because he will
go to the Elite and that old she-devil will not tell him where
to find me and I have never let him come to this house on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
account of his wife being so mad and all and I do not think
he even knows my number and if I write to his home his
wife will get it and he has told me never to ring him up nor
to write to him to the big white house for fear the Spokesman
or somebody might get in. What I am to do I cannot
think but tomorrow I will have to look for a job in
some barber-shop.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>P. S. Well has been another rainy day and I have tried
the barber-shops and gee Mom there was some awful holes
where a decent girl would not work if it was to save her
life but even so I did not find nothing. There was one feller
that said he would give me a table for half what I earned
but I would have to of had my own set and I have not got
no set and no money to buy one. And gee Mom I see I
should of saved some of my money but what it is I should of
gone without I cannot see. And some fellers was rude to
me and some called me sweet-heart and I would of liked to
of batted both kinds on the jaw.</p>

<p>But please do not say anything to Pop about my troubles
because it would only worry him and I am going to find some
way out. My rent is not due till two days, and I guess I
have got a few days credit with Mrs. Budd seeing that she
had such a fine lot of gossip out of that time that Mrs.
Edgerton come to bawl me out for going to dinner with her
husband.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>P. S. Again. Well I have went to about fifty hotels big
and little and to a lot more barber-shops but nothing doing.
And I have only et some milk and crackers because I am
scared of spending my last money. But I had to buy a
paper of course for I must not get out of touch with international
affairs. And I see there is a great coal strike being
threatened and the whole country will be without coal and
nobody knows what to do about it and it says the Spokesman
announced that He has took the matter under advisement
and of course I know what that means He does not
know what to say about it and He is waiting for me to tell
Mr. Edgerton to tell Him what to say. I picture Mr. Edgerton
rushing around frantic trying to find out where I am
and maybe having to call in the secret service and so I am
desperate and tonight I have wrote him a letter to the big
white house and I have wrote it like this, Dear Sir, My
father Mr. James Riggs wishes me to advise you that he
has changed his address, and then I give the address of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
room and I think that is not suspicious and I will come home
early tomorrow and see if he has sent me a telegram or
maybe a special delivery letter.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>P. S. Another. Well Mom I have had an awful grief
and you sure do get troubles when you go into public life
it is more dangerous than any Western I have ever saw. I
have been trying to get a job as a waitress or anything and
about five o’clock I come home tired as a dog and who should
I see going up the steps of the house but Walter. He is
just about to ring the bell when I hollers and he turns
round and in about three seconds more he is got me in his
arms and gee Mom it is awful what muscles that boy is
got packing crates all day and throwing them onto trucks.
And there he makes a show of me in the street and pulls
me to pieces and I am so excited that I am crying. And he
tells me that the warehouse shut up for a day on account
of the boss’s wife having died and it is Saturday and so he
is got two days off and has throwed away all this money for
a trip to Washington just to see me.</p>

<p>He wants me to go to dinner of course and I tell him to
hold his horses while I run upstairs and powder my nose
and so I go and when I come down again what do I see?
Walter is still standing down on the sidewalk and up at the
top of the step is Mr. Edgerton just about to ring the bell!
You see how it is they do not know each other of course
and Mr. Edgerton is come right at that inconvenient moment
and there he is. When he sees me of course he lifts
his hat and he says, “How do you do Miss Riggs?” he
says. “Well I am sure glad to get in touch with you I have
not had nobody to go to dinner with and I am so lonesome
I do not know where to go.” He says that kind of jolly like
he always is you know but he is got a pretty loud voice and
there is Walter listening to every word of it and then looking
at the taxi-cab that is brought Mr. Edgerton and his
face is as black as the thunderstorm we had this morning.</p>

<p>Well a women that is trained to social life like me had
ought to know what to do but I don’t and all I can say is,
“Mr. Edgerton I have a friend that is just come to see me.”
And Mr. Edgerton is rattled too because of course he don’t
want to meet nobody. But there is nothing to do but go
down the steps and I says, “Mr. Edgerton meet Mr. Rigley,”
I says and Walter is not got sense to shake hands but
just growls how-de-do and I am thinking as fast as a runaway
express train.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>Walter he says, “Well I see you have a previous engagement,”
and he turns on his heel and starts to walk off but
of course I grabs him by the arm and makes him turn
round and I says, “Look here Walter this is not what you
think this is a business matter and this gentleman is a government
official and I am doing important work for him,” I
says. “What sort of work?” says Walter and you know
that kind of pug-nose face that he has got it is already made
up for a fight.</p>

<p>And of course I can’t answer him because Mr. Edgerton
has forbid me to. So what can I do but put it up to Mr.
Edgerton? I says, “Mr. Edgerton, Walter Rigley is my
fyansay,” I says. And Mr. Edgerton says, “Oh I did not
know you was engaged,” and I says, “I have never had occasion
to tell you. But now Walter is got two days off from
the job of packing goods in a warehouse and he has come
to see me as a surprise party. And I think I have got to
explain matters to him if you will please let me because he
is a very good boy and a one hundred percent American and
when he knows that this is government work that we are doing
and that it is because we have got to educate the people
and keep the Bolshivikis from getting a hold of them he will
keep the secret and you can trust him the same as me.”</p>

<p>So Mr. Edgerton can’t do nothing else but say, “All right
Miss Riggs I will take your word for Mr. Rigley.” And I
turns to Walter and says, “There is nobody in the world but
my mom and my pop that I have trusted with this but
it is all straight and it will be explained to you.”</p>

<p>And then Mr. Edgerton says for Walter to go to dinner
with us but Walter he says, “Not on your life I ast her first,”
he says, “and if there is any dinner you will go with me.”
So I says, “It will have to be that way Mr. Edgerton because
I know this boy and he is only got one fault and
that is that he is a mule.”</p>

<p>So Mr. Edgerton says all right and we gets into the taxi
and Walter’s shoulders is so broad that there is no room for
mine in the seat but he puts me on his knees and you can
see he is not going to let me be in Mr. Edgerton’s way. And
I am telling Walter about who Mr. Edgerton is and what
we are doing and gee you can see that it is a hard lump
for Walter to swallow he don’t know what to make of it
whether I am kidding him or not but Walter is like the
Spokesman in one way when he don’t know what to say it
don’t hurt him none to say nothing.</p>

<p>Well the Greek restaurant is nearest and so we are pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
soon eating some more dinner cooked in mutton suet but
gee Mom I could eat it if it was axel-grease I am so hungry.
But I have got to play the social game and keep these two
male animals from biting each other so I says, “Mr. Edgerton
I have not had no chance to ask you but I can see that
the Spokesman is in trouble because He does not know what
to say about this here coal strike.”</p>

<p>And he says, “That is right it is a very great worry to
Him, and what do you think about it?” And I says, “Well
Pop says you can’t make no gas without coal and what would
I do if I come home to my room in the evening and there
was no light in it?” And Mr. Edgerton says, “That is true,
coal is a necessity of modern civilization.” “Well then,” I
says, “is a lot of Hunkies and Dagoes to be allowed to get
together and hold a pistol at people’s heads and get any
price they please for work? No Mr. Edgerton,” I says, “it
is the duty of the Spokesman to take a firm stand and say
that there will not be no such strike allowed.”</p>

<p>And he says, “I guess you are right and we will work it
out on that basis.”</p>

<p>But I says, “Mr. Edgerton He must not go and say that
unless He means to act on it.”</p>

<p>And he says, “But why not?” and I says, “Because it will
not do.” And he says, “Well Miss Riggs but you cannot do
business with the Spokesman that way because you would
never be able to say nothing because He will never do
nothing.”</p>

<p>But I says, “If He says He won’t allow the strike and
then He does allow it, what will people think of Him?” And
he says, “It will be like it has always been and when the
time comes people will of forgot it.” “But that is nonsense,”
I says, “it will be quoted against Him what He said at the
beginning.” And Mr. Edgerton says, “By who? A bunch
of cranks here and there? The newspapers will not say
nothing because we have got them and what else does it
matter?”</p>

<p>Well of course I don’t like that but I have learned that it
is what you have got to do with the Spokesman so I says
“All right.” But I have forgot about Walter and my God
all of a sudden what do I see his face is got red and he is
rose up and he says, “Do the pair of you really think I am
going to stand for this?” “Why Walter what do you
mean?” I says, and he says, “You are playing me for a
sucker,” he says, “but you have got the wrong one.”</p>

<p>“Why Walter,” I says, “what on earth? You think this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
is not the Spokesman’s Secretary?” “I don’t know who it
is,” he says, “but you cannot make me believe that the
Spokesman is no such poor fish as this.” “But,” I says
“look at the papers to-morrow afternoon,” I says, “and you
will see it all just as I have said it.”</p>

<p>And says Walter, “You want me to think that the American
people is a bunch of boobs that you can string along
like this?” I says, “Walter, I have told Mr. Edgerton that
you are a patriot and a lover of your country and that you
can be trusted with these great state secrets,” I says, “And
now are you going to throw me down?”</p>

<p>But he looks at me and his eyes is flashing and his fists is
clenched and I think he is going to hit me or Mr. Edgerton
I aint sure which and he says with his voice trembling
furious, “Mamie Riggs,” he says, “I thought you was a decent
girl but I see you have took the easy road,” he says.
“But it was enough to insult our love,” he says, “you needn’t
of insulted my brains too. I leave you to your new gentleman
and I hope he keeps you good and that’s all.” And with
that he turns and walks off quick and I lets out a yell that
scares the whole dining room and I runs to grab him but he
is gone out the door and lost in the crowd and there I am
standing and crying like Lucy Lonesome in “The Broken
Love.”</p>

<p class="ph3">IN WHICH I AM MADE A GRAMMARIAN</p>


<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mom</span>:<br>
</p>

<p>Well here it is a Sunday morning and I have got no job
and I have got no lover and I am sure in the dumps. But
Mom you have got to see Walter for me quick as you can
and explain to him how foolish he is been to quarrel with
me because it is all true like I told him. You must make
him understand that Mr. Edgerton really is the Secretary to
the Spokesman and that the great Man up at the big white
house does really say everything that me and Mr. Edgerton
says for Him to say. And if it is not always true what
He says well I know how shocked I was when I first found
it out but you that have been a great actress can explain to
that poor kid Walter how it is that you have got to play the
play the way it is wrote and not the way you think it had
ought to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>And if you can fix it up with Walter you do not have to
worry about me Mom for I will sure get some job even if
I have to go to work in a factory. And I am going to go
straight for your sake and Pop’s even if Walter does believe
all them hateful things about me that he said to me and
right before Mr. Edgerton. Well I am going to rest my
tired feet today and tomorrow I will start out looking for a
job in a department store.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>P. S. Oh Mom I have had the most wonderful good fortune!
I told you onst that I am Cinderella and that the fairy
coach was waiting for me and now it is going to take me
right almost into the palace!</p>

<p>Well Monday a. m. I start out hunting a job and the sun
is come out hot and it is like summer and I have got on my
winter suit and I am nearly fainting so I have to go home
and change it and gee all that I have got is a shirtwaist that
is got a darn in the elbow and my old blue skirt that is all
faded and it sure does make me miserable to look like that
when I have been such a real lady all winter. But I put it
on and am starting out again when my landlady calls me
she is got a telegram that is come for me it is got no name
signed but it says for me to come to lunch at the little cheap
place where we have et when we was scared of Mrs. Edgerton.
And of course I know it is Mr. Edgerton and I want
to run back and get my good clothes on but I am late already
and have got to hustle for the street car.</p>

<p>Well there is Mr. Edgerton waiting for me and he has
been there quite a while and he says there is a serious
emergency in the government and he needs my advice and it
is very inconvenient not to be able to get me quick when he
needs me. And I says, “I am so sorry but I was out hunting
for a job.”</p>

<p>“What?” he says. “A job? Why is that?”</p>

<p>“Did you not understand that I am no more at the Elite
Beauty Parlors?” I says.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he says, “but I thought you must of got something
better.”</p>

<p>“I have not got nothing,” I says. “I left that place because
I am a free American citizen,” I says, “and I would not
stand for having that old she-devil bossing me about. And
all them girls is a pack of sheep but I am one that is got
some spirit.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” he says. “And what are your plans?”</p>

<p>“I am trying to get into a department store.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>“Oh Miss Riggs,” he says, “but do not do that because
you had ought to have some job that will leave you time to
get off now and then when your country needs you,” he says.</p>

<p>“That is all very well,” I says, “but my country has never
showed me no such job,” I says.</p>

<p>“But why did you not tell me about it?” he says.</p>

<p>“I did not have a chanced,” I says, “what with the way
that crazy boy Walter behaved and made me so ashamed and
anyhow I am not going to put my troubles off on you,” I
says.</p>

<p>“Troubles?” he says. “But that is absurd Miss Riggs.
What is an Administration for if it is not to have jobs?”</p>

<p>“You mean that you can find me one?” I says and my
heart is give a jump with excitement.</p>

<p>“Why of course,” he says. “I am the Grand Mogul of
Jobs,” he says. “I carry lists of them around with me I
sometimes have more jobs than I can find people,” he says.</p>

<p>And sure enough he pulls out some papers from his pocket
and there is a long printed list and he says these is civil service
jobs for which there is to be examinations. “And let us
see now,” and he studies it and he reads, “Geographer,” and
he says, “Do you think you would like to be a Geographer?”
And I says, “My God what does that do?” And then he
reads, “Geologist,” and he says, “That might sound pretty
good.”</p>

<p>But I says, “How can I pass an examination for such jobs
as them?” and he says, “You do not have to worry about that
we can pay somebody to do that for you,” he says, and then
he reads, “Grammarian,” and he says, “There now I think
that would be a fine job for you there is something cultured
about being a Grammarian.”</p>

<p>“But dear me,” I says, “what would I have to do?” And
he says, “You will not have to do nothing,” he says, “there
is always an assistant that does the work for half as much,”
he says. And I says, “Is that what they call economy?” and
he says, “It is a system,” he says. “How could you keep
politics going unless people had jobs in between elections?
But it is common sense you can see that politicians do not
have no time to learn to be geographers and geologists and
grammarians and so there have got to be assistants that
know that sort of work and keep the assistants’ jobs all the
time no matter who gets elected,” he says.</p>

<p>And then he says, “You will be Grammarian to the Bureau
of Indian Affairs of the Department of the Interior,” he
says. And I says, “Can they put somebody off on a department<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
like that?” And he says, “Oh sure it is done all the
time there is the private secretary to the Spokeslady there
was no provision for such but She wanted one so they put
it off on the Interstate Trade Commission,” he says.</p>

<p>And he goes on to study the list and he says, “This is not
a very good job for the salary is only $26 per week.” “Man
alive,” I says, “that is more money than I have ever had all
at once in my life I think!” He says, “You will find your
tastes grow and in a year you will be wanting your own car,”
he says.</p>

<p>And then he thinks a bit and he says, “Maybe we can get
you an allowance for travelling expenses.” I says, “Does a
Grammarian have to travel?” and he says, “We will have
you made a Field Grammarian and then you will be able to
go wherever you want to and that will be necessary anyhow
because you see if it stays hot like this very long the Spokesman
will be moving to His summer home and I will have to
go there and so will you and it will be much better if you
have a government position then because it will not look so
bad if we are saw together in a small town.”</p>

<p>And then he looks at me a moment and he says kind of
hesitating, “Miss Riggs, will you pardon me if I am extremely
personal for a moment?” And I says, “Go to it,”
and then he tells me that the fashion in the present Administration
is for a different shade of ladies’ hair from what I
have got. “The old Administration was what you might call
a peroxide one,” he says, “but the present one runs to pastel
shades and I think it would be easier for both of us if you
was to tone yours down. I don’t know much about it, but
I suppose there is ways.”</p>

<p>“Oh sure,” I says, “what have I been in a beauty parlors
for? I can cut most of it off and wear some sort of a turban
effect till the new color grows out,” I says. “Or I can cut
it real short and say that I have had the typhoid fever or
something.” And he says, “All right typhoid is more respectable
than peroxide and when you have got that done we can
go to better restaurants for our dinners.”</p>

<p>Well so then I says, “How is the missus getting along
these days and has she said anything more about me?”</p>

<p>And he tells me that she has got something new to occupy
her mind she is being syked—I don’t know if that quite the
right word but it is the way it sounds and he explained to
me the way to be syked there is a man and you pay him ten
dollars an hour to listen to you tell him all your troubles and
about your soul and he says that it is got to be the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
fashionable thing for ladies to be syked. And I says, “It is
a pretty expensive fashion it seems to me,” but he says, “My
God no not at all this town is full of husbands that would
pay a man ten dollars an hour to listen to their wife’s troubles
all day long and the night too,” he says. “And it is a great
relief to their friends as well.” And I says, “Then while she
is being syked you and me can go to dinner,” and he says,
“Exactly.”</p>

<p>Well then he tells me what it is that he wants to ask me
about and it seems there is an international problem because
there is a Hungarian count that wants to come into this country
because his wife is here and she is sick but he is not being
let to come because they say he is a Bolshiviki but there is
an awful fuss being made about it.</p>

<p>And I says, “But why I thought we had regular laws to
keep them Dagos and Hunkies and Wops out of this country.”
And he says, “Yes, but this one is a sure enough count
and is a rich man too and the laws is not meant for that sort.
And besides,” he says “the state department is not got very
much nerve just now the old gentleman that is in charge of
it is called by the name of Scared Sally and he is even more
scared than the Spokesman Himself. He was a senator from
his home state but that state kicked him out and so the
Spokesman is give him a home in the cabinet; and he is
scared of this Bolshiviki count to let him in and he is scared
to not let him in and they are all in a terrible stew up at the
big white house and this evening there is got to be a statement
give out about why he is not let in and they can’t think
of no reasons except some that they cannot give out.”</p>

<p>“And what is them?” I says and he tells me a funny story,
gee it is complicated these international affairs!</p>

<p>It seems that some of the young fellers in this state department
is gone and got themselves wives out of this here foreign
nobility thinking it was something extra swell you know
but now there is come revolutions and all these Dago counts
and Hunky princes and Wop grand dukes is kicked out or
is about to get kicked out and the young men in the state
department finds themselves stuck with second-hand wives
as you might say that is to say they is badly faded and passay
and not noble or swell no more. In this here country of
Hungary they have got back but only for a little while because
this Bolshiviki count is going to kick them out again
and so they hate him and that is why our state department is
fighting so hard to help them and keep the secretarie’s wives
noble as long as it can be done. And that is why our government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
lends loans to these countries and why they dassn’t allow
that nobody shall come in from them countries and tell
what is going on there.</p>

<p>And I says, “But Mr. Edgerton it seems to me that in a
case like that it is very plain what to do.” “And what is it?”
he says. And I says, “I would say that it is a situation that
the least said about it the better.” And he says, “Yes of
course.” And I says, “Then why not say the least?” And
he says, “What is the least?” And I says, “The least is
nothing.”</p>

<p>Well he looks at me like I was prophet come down from
heaven or something and he says, “My God Miss Riggs you
are a wonder!” “No,” I says, “I am only a field Grammarian,”
I says, “but even so I can see that when there is
nothing you can say the thing to do is to hold your mouth.
And I have heard so much in the papers about this Spokesman
being a Strong Silent Man and it is seems to me that
this is just the time for Him to be Strong in His Silence and
Silent in His Strength,” I says, “and you had better just
make up your mind that this here Bolshiviki count stays
out and that nobody says a word about it from the first
to the last,” I says, “and that is the way I would play the
game of politics if I was Him.”</p>

<p>And he says, “Miss Riggs you <i>are</i> Him, I believe! You
are Him in the Female Incarnation!” And so I am</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">IN WHICH I BECOME A SYKER</p>


<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mom</span>:<br>
</p>

<p>I have your letter in which you send me two dollars and
it is sure good of you and Pop to think of me with all the
troubles of your own you have got. It come at just the right
moment for I had got down to only nine cents, and I did not
dare to buy the morning paper to see what the Spokesman
has been saying. Mr. Edgerton has got it fixed that I have
been appointed Emergency Field Grammarian but I do not
get the salary until Saturday and these two dollars will save
my life.</p>

<p>And oh Mom I am glad that you will talk to Walter for
me. I know that you and Pop are not keen about having me
in love with a poor shipping-clerk but all the same that is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
what is kept me good through all the temptations of a great
city and so you must help me and make Walter understand
that I really am helping Mr. Edgerton like I say and telling
him what he is to tell the Spokesman to tell to the American
people.</p>

<p>Well Mr. Edgerton is been so good I have saw him again
and he seen that I had on that poor old shirtwaist and he
says, “Why where is your fine good clothes?” he says. And
so I have to tell him that it is got so hot that I cannot wear
a winter suit no more and he says, “Come along now you
have got to be dressed like a Grammarian,” he says and so
he takes me into a department store and buys me everything
all new a pearl grey suit with a hat and shoes and all and so
I can be a summer lady as well as a winter one.</p>

<p>But he tells me some very bad news that the secretary of
state that they call Scared Sally has decided that he will let
that Bolshiviki count come into the country provided that he
does not do no propaganda about politics while he is here but
will only see his wife that is sick. And I says, “My God Mr.
Edgerton that is a mistake because them fellers is not to be
trusted and anybody can see that it is propaganda for a feller
like that just to be alive.”</p>

<p>And he says, “That is exactly right Miss Riggs it is what
I have said to them.”</p>

<p>And I says, “But why does the Spokesman allow such
things?” and he says that He is leaving it all to that Scared
Sally.</p>

<p>And I says, “But Mr. Edgerton they have already give
out a statement that he will not be let to come in. The
Spokesman has said it Himself.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he says, “but the Spokesman can always take back
what He has said.”</p>

<p>“But Mr. Edgerton,” I says, “how can He when He is
said it to a hundred newspaper reporters and they have wrote
it down?”</p>

<p>“He just says that He didn’t say it and they all have to
say they made a mistake.”</p>

<p>“But my God don’t none of them ever kick?”</p>

<p>“Two of them done it onst but all they got was they was
not allowed to no more interviews which put them out of
business and taught the others better.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I says, “if a Man has got all the newspapers where
you can walk on their faces like that,” I says, “why does He
want an electric camelephant to ride?”</p>

<p>He says it has always been that way there used to be what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
was called an Ananias Club in Washington and that was for
people that had objected to the Spokesman changing his
mind. He says that now they don’t allow no stenographic
notes of the Spokesman’s interviews so that it will not be possible
to prove what He has said. “And so you see,” he says,
“how easy it is to be a Great Man.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I says, “they will see that Hunkie count will make
a fool out of them all,” and he says, “That is exactly what
will happen and it will give the Spokesman a black eye worse
than the one that He got up there when He had the police-strike,”
he says. “The truth is I am sick of telling Him what
to do and not having it done and if somebody was to offer me
a good position in private life I would take it tomorrow.”</p>

<p>I says, “Oh Mr. Edgerton do not desert your country and
do not desert me.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry Mamie Riggs,” he says and that is the
first time he has ever called me Mamie. “I am not agoing to
desert you and you will have a friend in me for the rest of
your life for you have got more sense than any male politician
in the business,” he says and of course that is a sweet
thing to say and he gives my arm a squeeze as we are walking
on the street but then I am scared because I have got to
remember that he is a married man and all.</p>

<p>So to remind him I says, “And how is the wife getting
on?”</p>

<p>He says, “Oh she is having the time of her life because this
getting syked is the best thing that is ever come along so she
says.”</p>

<p>And then he goes on to tell me about this and it seems that
a lady pays this syking man ten dollars an hour to listen to
her troubles and about her soul and she gets to be more and
more interested in that syker and that is a regular part of the
treatment it seems and it is called by a long name it is a
Transference.</p>

<p>And I says, “Well Mr. Edgerton they are always getting
new names for old things,” I says, “for when you go to a
moving picture that thing is what is called a Triangle.”</p>

<p>He laughs and says that is so but I can see that he is kind
of sore about it and he says, “That feller is got Mrs. Edgerton
running there to see him every day and telling him her
fusses with me and he is calling her up on the phone and
making dates with her and I have made up my mind that I
am not going to stand it much longer and I have told her so
in plain words.”</p>

<p>And I says, “But look here Mr. Edgerton,” I says, “how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
is this that you are calling me up on the phone and making
dates with me and you do not want her to object to that,” I
says.</p>

<p>“Oh,” he says, “but that is different.”</p>

<p>And I says, “But why is it different?” and he says, “Because
it is a matter of business with you and me.”</p>

<p>And I says, “Yes, but it is a matter of business with him
also and if he is getting ten dollars an hour for it it is a matter
of very good business indeed.”</p>

<p>He is kind of embarrassed and says, “She has not failed to
point that out to me.” And I says, “She naturally would
not fail because we women are good at seeing things that is
right in front of our eyes,” I says, “and what is sauce for the
goose is sauce for the gander though not meaning to speak
disrespectful of you and Mrs. Edgerton,” I says. “Now you
have got to give her a square deal and you may be sure that
I am not going to help you do nothing else.”</p>

<p>And he laughs and says that I have become his syker and
I says, “Well at least I have cost you less than ten dollars
an hour,” I says.</p>

<p>Well we go to a restaurant a swell one because I have got
my swell new clothes now and I have got my bright hair all
cut off and my head fixed with a veil and I am a respectable
Emergency Field Grammarian so that a member of the Administration
can buy me a dinner without its being a scandal.
And Mom in this place they are so respectable that they bring
the cocktails to you in a soup-tureen and you eat them out of
a dish with a spoon and gee Mom it is so funny!</p>

<p>And we are talking all about international affairs and Mr.
Edgerton tells me the most interesting things it seems that the
police has just arrested a way high-up bootlegger and how
they come to do such a thing he cannot say but the police is
getting more and more higher handed all the time. I shall
never forget my indignation while that one was shooing me
away from the Elite Beauty Parlors while I was leading the
strike.</p>

<p>Well anyhow they have got this bootlegger and he is got
a notebook on him with all the addresses of his customers
and how much they have bought and all and gee Mom it is
the most awful thing because there is senators and judges
and some Persons the most sacred so that I would not dare to
put it into a letter except to say that a very very special friend
of mine is one of them and had just got a case of genuine
Scotch that very week and now it seems that some of them
dry fellers in Congress is got a hold of the story and is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
threatening to make speeches about it and of course none of
the papers is saying a word but still everybody is scared because
something might bust open. He says that is always the
way in political life you can never be really safe because
there is always some Bolshiviki senators that makes speeches
and there is Bolshiviki papers that will print what they say.</p>

<p>And he told me all about how it was when this new Spokesman
first come into office there was the most dreadful lot
of scandals because it was found that some of the brass kings
had been buying up the government. He explained to me
how it is these brass fellers is very rich and great sports
and is used to getting what they want and paying what it
costs even if it is a member of the cabinet. And it seems
that the government owned a huge brass teapot somewhere
in the West and it was the brass reserve for the navy so that
if ever there was to be a war we would be able to make all
the brass buttons that would be needed for the sailors’ uniforms.
But it seems that one of the brass kings paid a hundred
thousand dollars in a black bag to a member of the
cabinet and got away with this brass teapot.</p>

<p>I says, “Look ahere Mr. Edgerton what is this that you
are telling me the plot of a movie that you seen last night?”
And he says, “Upon my word no it is exactly what happened
and I would rather of had to enlist and sit for four years
with German big Berthas dropping bomb-shells onto me than
go through with all that trouble again.”</p>

<p>I says, “What did you have to do with it?” and he says,
“I was the Spokesman’s Secretary all through it the same as
I am now and my God you could not think of anything so
awful in a nightmare. You would spend hours thinking up
a story and then hold a session of the cabinet and get everybody
to agree and learn it by heart and then early next morning
you would get a call from the chief of the secret service
that in the night they had raided the rooms of one of them
Bolshiviki senators that was doing the exposures and they
had found out that these senators had got evidence that
would knock your story into a cocked hat. And then you
would have to begin telephoning to all the members of the
cabinet to get them to change the story and a few hours later
the secret service would bring you word that the Bolshiviki
senators had tapped your telephone lines and heard what
your new story was to be. It went on like that for weeks,”
he says, “and the Spokesman was just about paralyzed with
fright.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I says, “Mr. Edgerton does it not suggest that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
maybe there is something in my idea of just telling the plane
truth all the time?” But he will not hear to no such Sunday
school talk as he calls it because he says, “How can you tell
the truth when the truth is that everybody you know has
been helping himself to everything he could get his hands
on?”</p>

<p>I says, “Mr. Edgerton there is a lot about this political
game that is hard for an outsider to understand and one of
the things is how it can be called patriotism and economy
and all that when people that holds high office is busy robbing
the government?” I says. “It seems to me we are
giving the Bolshivikis too easy an argument if that is the
ways things is.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he says, “I know it seems like that and it is complicated
and hard for the plain people to understand but I
have heard the Spokesman Himself explain it and it is quite
all right when you get His ideas. You see there is all kinds
of wealth that the government is got but is not able to make
use of it because the government is got no business being in
business which it cannot run economical or efficient. The
right people to own all these resources is the big business
men that is got the money and brains and everything and so
it is a real advantage to the people when the business men get
these things away from the government.”</p>

<p>“You mean even when they have got to steal them?” I
says.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he says, “that is what the Spokesman thinks and in
the long run He is right because for example take this here
teapot and you will see that while the government owned it
it was not doing nothing but now that the brass kings have
got it they have set it on the fire and it is boiling away and
making tea for people to drink.”</p>

<p>“Well that sounds all right,” I says, “but I would want to
know which people is drinking the tea and is it the brass
kings?”</p>

<p>“Well yes,” he says, “I suppose it is them that gets the
most of the tea but then if they hadn’t of stole the teapot
there wouldn’t nobody of got no tea at all.”</p>

<p>So you see again Mom how complicated these international
affairs is and what a tremendous job I have got to understand
them. But you tell Pop that he does not ever need to worry
that I will get a swelled head even though I am getting to
understand them better than him.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">IN WHICH I STICK TO THE JOB</p>


<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mom</span>:<br>
</p>

<p>I have got my first week’s salary as Emergency Field
Grammarian and gee it is wonderful. All that I have to do
is to go to the department and sign my name three times and
I get what is called a warrant that anybody will give me the
money for. And I felt so rich and fine with that $26 in my
purse the first thing I did was to buy this money order to pay
you back your two spots and three spots extra.</p>

<p>And then I remembered what Mr. Edgerton said that I
must not lose touch with the plain people but remember
how they feel so that I will be able to tell him so that he
can tell the Spokesman up at the big white house what to
say to all the newspaper reporters. So I decided that I
would meet some plain people right away so what should I
do but pay a call on the Elite Beauty Parlors? It is lovely
warm spring weather and I have got on my fine new clothes
and I walk in as cool as a pineapple sundae and look round
and see that Floradumbelle has no customer so I walk to her
table and sit myself down and I says, “Well good afternoon
and how is things going in the old shop?”</p>

<p>Well there is the madame and she glares at me like the
old she-devil that she is, and Floradumbelle she stares with
her mouth open and all the other girls is stopping their work
to stare and I am taking off my pearl grey gloves in no hurry
and I says, “I would like to have a manicuring if this shop
aint raised its prices too many times since I was here.”</p>

<p>So of course what can she do but start work and the
madame what can she do but hold her mouth and me what
am I there for but to talk? So I says in a good loud voice,
“Oh Flora dear I am having such a wonderful time and rising
so fast in the world I am an Emergency Field Grammarian
to the Bureau of Indian Affairs of the Department of
the Interior and it is a most responsible position and I do
not have to do a thing except what I please and I can travel
and have an allowance for expenses and I am going to Camden
New Jersey the first time I can be spared from the
government and see my Mom and my Pop and my fyansay.
And hello Adair,” I says, “and hello Hotaire and hello Mary
May Marie,” I says, “I thought I would drop in for the sake
of old times because you see I have got to keep in touch
with the plain people and not forget how it is that they feel
and what they think about international affairs. And what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
do you say to this idea of the secretary of state that they call
Scared Sally letting in this Bolshiviki count to be with his
sick wife?” I says.</p>

<p>Well it costs me two-fifty to have that splurge but there is
nothing that has made me feel so good since I come to Washington,
D. C. And then I have a stroll down the street and
look at all the pretty things in the shop windows and think
that I am going to have seven-fifty more each week to spend
like I want to only for what I send to you Mom and I sure
do think this is a wonderful government and the greatest
country in the whole world. And then I have got a date to
have dinner with Mr. Edgerton in that same Imperial Cafay
where you get the cocktails in a soup-tureen and I tell him
about how I been to the Elite and show him what was
the expression on Madame Lafferty’s face and he says,
“Mame,” he says, “you might of been a great actress like
your Mom.”</p>

<p>Well then I tell him what the girls is said about that there
Bolshiviki count that is to be let into the country and what
a mistake it is and he says, “You can see the mistake for
already the news has been cabled to that there Hungry
country and there is a lot of stuff cabled back about what it
is that the count would of said if he had not of pledged that
he would not say nothing.” And I says, “Yes I have read it
and it is terrible stuff and I do not understand because it
says this here Bolshiviki count is charging that the people
that is opposing him is killing and shooting people and torturing
them in dungeons and all that and all the time I have
been told that it is the Bolshivikis that does that and here
it seems to be the other side that is doing it.”</p>

<p>And he says, “So you see just how the propaganda works,”
he says, “that is the whole purpose to get you to asking questions
like that.”</p>

<p>But I says, “Is it true?”</p>

<p>And he says, “There it is,” he says, “you can see how he
has sewed some doubts into a mind that had never before
had none but had always believed the right thing.”</p>

<p>“Yes but look here Mr. Edgerton stop kidding me I want
to know what is the truth.”</p>

<p>“Yes but my dear Mamie I want to show you how this
poison spreads because here you are pushing me for an
answer and if it had not of been for this here count you
would never of thought about it at all.”</p>

<p>And then he stops kidding and explains how it is that on
one side is ladies and gentlemen what is doing the killing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
and on the other side it is just common dirty workingmen
and of course our country is got to see to it that the side of
refinement is victorious and that the wives of the young sectaries
in the state department is not stopped from being
noble and rich. It would be breaking up the home he
says if it was to be any other way for what would become
of the foreign matrimonial market if our young men of
fashion was to pay for a peach and find they have got a
lemon?</p>

<p>Well I guess I am being a dumbell again but I do not know
exactly whether he is joking but it seems that he is real
angry because his advice is not took and the Spokesman is
not got the sense to stay as the Strong Silent Man which is
what Mr. Edgerton made Him and the only thing that any
man can be when He does not know enough to be nothing
else.</p>

<p>And by and by we got out of the restaurant and are walking
in the park and it is moonlight and soft and sweet and
romantic and Mr. Edgerton he says, “Well I have got some
news for you my dear Mamie that I fear will make you very
sad I am going to quit this job as the Spokesman’s Secretary.”
And I says, “My God!” and my knees is like to give
away.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he says, “what is happened is that some of the brass
kings is come to me with a proposition it seems they are planning
a great new brass trust that is to include all the brass
mines and mills of the entire country and they are scared the
public may not like it and may make a fuss and force the
Spokesman to do something about it and so they have asked
will I come and be their head press agent and fix the stories
that they will tell to all the newspapers and they have offered
me just about three times what I am getting now not
only from the government but from the private funds of
them that is put me here to manage the Spokesman for them.
And so I am going to take this new job.”</p>

<p>Well I am so weak that I have to set on a bench and I
says, “Oh Mr. Edgerton I will be so lonely!”</p>

<p>And he says, “That is just what I want to say that you
are to come with me.”</p>

<p>“With you Mr. Edgerton but where?”</p>

<p>“To Chicago for that is where the brass trust is to have
its offices.”</p>

<p>“But oh,” I says, “what would I do in Chicago?”</p>

<p>“You will be free,” he says, “and so will I because why,”
he says, “when you are in private business you can have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
some fun and you do not have to worry about a lot of
meddlesome Matties and old women in pants that is watching
everything you do. And you and me can have a little apartment
and be as jolly as two turtle-doves.” And while he
says that he is put his arm about me and he says, “Oh Mame
I am sure fond of you for you are the gamest kid I ever got
to know and wouldn’t you like to have a nice little love-nest
and with nobody to look out for but just me?”</p>

<p>Well Mom I am trembling all over because it is all so
sudden and after all I do think that Mr. Edgerton is a
mighty fine man and I have never had nothing so lovely as an
apartment and he is holding me close and I can hardly think
straight but I says, “Oh Mr. Edgerton do not tempt me,” I
says, “for I have always been a good girl and always gone
straight.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he says, “but there is nothing wrong with this for
we are real friends.”</p>

<p>“But you have got a wife!” I says.</p>

<p>“But she does not care for me she is interested in that
syker now.”</p>

<p>“But that is only for a moment,” I says, “and she does
love you I know for I have saw it in her face and what is
more I know that you love her because else why should you
of been jealous of the syker? And then too I have got a
fyansay and you know he is a good boy—”</p>

<p>“But my God Mamie will you go and throw yourself away
on a shipping-clerk what kind of a life is that for an intellectual
girl like you that is learned to understand all about international
affairs?” he says. “Why you will go and live in
some hole with him and you will have eleven babies and
spend your life over a washtub and it is a crime.”</p>

<p>“I know it is hard,” I says, “but you talk about the plain
people and what they think—”</p>

<p>“Oh to hell with the plain people!” he says. “That is all
bunk and you know it”—just like that he says it and of
course I am shocked and I do not want him to keep his arm
around me then.</p>

<p>I says, “Mr. Edgerton,” I says, “you are going now to be a
shirt-stuffer or whatever you call it for the brass kings and
so I suppose you have got to feel like that about the plain
people and trample them beneath your heel,” I says, “but I
am going to stay one of them like I have always been because
there is my Mom and my Pop and my kid brothers and
sisters and a good honest boy that I have promised to wait
for. And I am very much obliged to you and I like you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
very much as I have always done but it makes me sad to see
that you are going to be cynical and lose all your ideals,” I
says.</p>

<p>And so then he sees it is no use and he says, “Then you
are going to stay a Field Grammarian Mame?”</p>

<p>I says, “About that I cannot tell,” I says. “Would it be
right for me to keep the job if I am not doing no work for
you and the Spokesman?”</p>

<p>“Oh Mame,” he says, “you are too fine a patriot to be living
in these degenerate times. Of course you can keep the
job for you have earned a hundred times the salary and if
that poor little Shrimp in the big white house had the
sense to of took your advice you would of saved Him for
another term. But now I don’t know what will happen to
Him.”</p>

<p>I says, “Is He going to have somebody to write His
speeches for Him?”</p>

<p>“My God of course,” he says, “that poor Fish He could
not write a speech for an Epsom Salts convention.”</p>

<p>“And then who is to do it?” I says and he tells me that Mr.
Grandaddy Prows is got back from Europe and him and
Senator Buttles is had a row as to which is to name the new
Secretary and so they have left it to Mr. Edgerton as usual
and he has picked out a newspaper friend of his and he says,
“Mame you will have to stand by him and help him because
when I look back on my past then I am sorry for this one’s
future.”</p>

<p>And I says, “Let me meet him at once Mr. Edgerton,”
and he says, “So that is all you care about me!” and I says,
“I am thinking about my duty to the plain people of this
great country,” and he says, “Mamie Riggs when they have
the first Woman Spokesman of this great country you have
got to be Her.”</p>

<p>So then we make a date to meet the new Secretary for
lunch tomorrow and I come home and there Mom I get your
letter telling me that you have saw Walter and he has agreed
to believe that I am good and pure and that he still loves
me and oh Mom I am so glad I did not yield to that
fearful temptation out there on the park bench in the moonlight!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>P. S. Well Mom I have just got back from having lunch
with the new Secretary and gee it is so wonderful I am more
happy than I know how to write. For he is a good man and
very serious and I do not think he will ever be cynical like I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
fear Mr. Edgerton is got to be. And he is very polite and respectful
and says how he has heard what fine ideas I have
give to Mr. Edgerton and he wants me to help him because
he knows what a hard time he is going to have especially at
the beginning.</p>

<p>And I says, “Yes Mr. Porkin,” for that is his name, “you
will find it hard because there is many questions that
people is trying to trap the Spokesman into talking about and
He is not being able to keep so quiet as He used to, and it
will mean His ruin because there is just nothing He can say
and why does He not say it? For example,” I says, “there
is this business about the Bolshiviki count when he comes
here there will be no end of a row to know why he can’t
talk what he wants to and then maybe when his wife gets
well she will want to know if she can talk and you know how
much harder it is to shut up a woman,” I says. “And then
there is this business about the big banker that is in the
cabinet Mr. Lemon or Melon or whatever fruit he is and why
he does not stop the bootlegging business while he is making
the whiskey and why he is got all the income taxes refunded
for his companies and why he is allowed to charge as high
as he wants for all the aluminum that us women is got to
have in our kitchens. You can just see there is nothing the
Spokesman can say about all that and you have got to see that
He says it. And there is this business about our lending
money to all these here Dago countries where the young secretaries
of the state department is got noble wives,” I says,
“and about the Spokesman having hid the reports of the
commission or what ever it is called that wanted to have the
price of sugar cut down and ruin all them sugar kings that
is keeping up our prosperity. I tell you Mr. Porkin,” I says,
“I have been studying hard and if there was time I could
tell you a hundred different things that if anybody can ever
get the Spokesman talking about then He is done for the rest
of His life,” I says, “and your job is just one and that is to
hammer into His Head day and night that when you have
got nothing you can say then you must say it and nothing
else.”</p>

<p>And he is listening to every word and it is plain he is impressed
and right in the middle of it he reaches over the table
and he says, “Miss Riggs, shake hands with me,” he says,
“for in you I have a political counsellor and you must promise
to stand by me and together we will save Him.”</p>

<p>Then I says, “Mr. Porkin, we will shake hands but what
I am trying to do is not so much to save Him as to save the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
American people from the great pain of finding out about
Him.”</p>

<p>And so Mom we are friends even better than I have been
with Mr. Edgerton and you need have no more worry about
the future of</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">An Essay in Economic Interpretation</p>


<p>“MAMMONART” studies the artists from a point of view entirely
new; asking how they get their living, and what they do for
it; turning their pockets inside out, seeing what is in them and
where it comes from.</p>

<p>“MAMMONART” puts to painters, sculptors, poets, novelists,
dramatists and composers the question already put to priests
and preachers, editors and journalists, college presidents and professors,
school superintendents and teachers: WHO OWNS YOU,
AND WHY?</p>

<p>“MAMMONART” examines art and literature as instruments of
propaganda and repression, employed by ruling classes of the
community; or as weapons of attack, employed by new classes
rising into power.</p>

<p>“MAMMONART” challenges the great ones now honored by critical
authority and asks to what extent they are servants of
ruling-class prestige and instruments of ruling-class safety.</p>

<p>“MAMMONART” asserts that mankind is today under the spell
of utterly false conceptions of what art is and should be; of
utterly vicious and perverted standards of beauty and dignity in
all the arts.</p>

<p>“MAMMONART” is a history of culture, and also a battle-cry.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
